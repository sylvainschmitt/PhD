**Take home message.**

*We hypothesised individual genetic and phenotypic variability within and among species to promote local coexistence within species complexes through microgeographic adaptations to topography and forest gap dynamics.*

## Topography and forest gap dynamics drive fine-scale spatio-temporal adaptations of individuals within and among species from two Neotropical species complexes.

### Symphonia globulifera and Eschweilera clade Parvifolia include distinct but connected species

* Three genetic species within Symphonia globulifera sensu lato 
* At least three genetic species within Eschweilera clade Parvifolia 
* Morphotypes and functional traits
* Topographic niches (beware to not anticipate next sections)
* Growth trajectories (beware to not anticipate next sections)
* Interspecific gene flow

### The history of Symphonia species in the Neotropics might be more complex than previously thought

* Results are limited to local scale but advocate for the definition of a new Symphonia species
* Species demographics with SFS and diversity metrics, and Barthe et al.
* Population phylogenetic with treemix and Santi unpublished results with SNAPP

### New insights in intraspecific trait variability advocate for their role in local adaptation and divergence of closely-related species

* Leaf functional strategy observed among species and communities is conserved within species
* Intraspecific leaf trait variability widens species’ niches and converges at species’ margins where niches overlap,  potentially implying local neutral processes. 
* Intraspecific trait variability favors local adaptation and divergence of closely-related species within species complexes.
* Hybridization may maintain intraspecific trait variability, despite transgressive introgression and disruptive gene flow.

### Ontogeny and plasticity can strongly impede the use of leaf functional traits 

* Measured leaf functional traits were mainly plastic and lacked adaptative signature 
* Measured leaf functional traits were unrelated to individual growth trajectory
* Ontogeny and environment (including weather) were the main drivers of leaf functional traits variation
* Should sampling include time variation to represent the typical leaf functional strategy ?
* Are leaf functional traits too wide and plastic proxies to represent individual functions and associated eco-evolutive strategy instead of only representing one leaf functioning ?
* Nevertheless, how leaf functional traits can be thus optimized to represent species functional strategies

### Topography drives species niche divergence

* Closely-related tree species had different realized optima for topographic niches but not forest ap dynamics
* The topographic wetness index and the relative elevation drive species and individual divergence of the two species complexes
* Symphonia species displayed genetic signatures of adaptations to topography

### Forest gap dynamics maintain individual genetic diversity within species

* Symphonia species  can grow in a diversity of successional niches
* Genotypic adaptive growth strategies to fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gaps allow that
* Fast-growing hares grow in forest gaps and slow-growing turtles in shaded closed-canopy patches.
* Eschweilera clade Parvifolia species showed intraspecific response to forest gap dynamics and growth but without a trade-off
* Does methodological issues (sampling, genomic data, statistical power) prevent us from detecting the trade-off in Eschweilera?
* Does Eschweilera ecology (slow growth and high wood resistance with strong mechanical resistance and elasticity) prevent us from detecting the trade-off or imply a different ecological strategy?

## Do adaptations of tree species and individuals to topography and forest gap dynamics promote coexistence within and among species within species complexes ?

### What does species complexes and syngameon represent in the Paracou communities?

* Species complexes and syngameon delineation in Paracou evidences and lack of evidences (distribution analyses, Gonzalez et al., 2009; Baraloto et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2015; Torroba-Balmori et al., 2017; Caron et al., 2019; Heuertz et al., 2020)
* Species complexes knowledge in Neotropics, and putatively Oldtropics, compared to temperate forests  (Cannon & Petit, 2019; Cannon & Lerdau 2019 answer to Levi et al. 2019 in PNAS)
* Evidences for the detection of cryptic species in widespread and abundant, supposedly well-known, tropical tree species (symcapture, Ewédjè et al., 2020)
* Frequency of recent evolutionary background versus species complexes

### Species complexes widely spread across habitats include species with pervasive niche differentiation

* Fine-scale topography variations drive differential adaptations  promoting, in fine, closely-related species coexistence  within tree species complexes.
* Not limited to Symphonia and Eschweilera in Paracou (distribution)
* Pervasive topography effect (Kraft et al. 2008, Ferry et al. 2010a; Itoh et al. 2003, Allié et al. 2015, Lan et al. 2016, but see Baldeck et al. 2013a)
* Edaphic properties and water use (Baltzer et al. 2005; Baldeck et al. 2013)
* Forest gap dynamics (Yamasaki et al. 2013)
* Does abundant species with a topographic wide niche show within species niches?
* Studied species respond to successional niches with individual adaptation within species instead of among species niche differentiation.
* Species overlaps of successional niches can lead to coexistence through emerging neutrality

### Does the eco-evolutionary structure of Neotropical synagameons explain their local and regional success?

* Reproductive isolation to support species differentiation, in addition to topographic niche, to avoid reproductive interference and a genetic melting pot in sympatry
* Ecological filtering of hybrids to avoid a genetic melting pot (dart frogs and butterflies examples)
* Adaptive introgression using gene flow for functional neutrality, coevolution/evolutionary mutualism, and reproductive assurance provided by hybridization, lowering the risk of local extinction (Cannon and Lerdau 2015)
* How to balance gene flow for adaptive introgression and reproductive barriers for reproductive isolation
* Subtle and maybe fragile equilibrium but powerful eco-evolutionary strategy leading to local and regional success (ter Steege and Paracou censuses for Symphonia and Eschweilera importance) ?

### Do syngameons shape the exceptional diversity of Neotropical forests?

* Topography and forest gap dynamics drive diversity within and among closely-related within species complexes promoting their coexistence
* Are syngameons a successful evolutionary temporally stable that maintain forest diversity?
* Are syngameons a transitional stage generating forest diversity?
* A question of time: does temporal stability and transitional stages generate and maintain forest diversity, i.e. participate in the Neotropical cradle and museum?

## Beyond species complexes: do adaptations to topography and forest gap dynamics promote coexistence within and among species from mature forests ?

### Intraspecific trait variation importance in the forest community

* We expect consistent intra- and inter-specific individual functional response to topography within many species of the community
* This may result in wider niches and emerging neutrality of many species in the forest community
* Unless inter-specific gene flow is maintaining individual diversity in species complexes, and once isolated species lose part of their individual diversity.
* But the lack of adaptive signal in functional traits advocates for functional plasticity to answer to the environment, in which case the first hypothesis seems more probable.
* Unless plasticity is genetically promoted through recent divergence or inter-specific gene flow

### Fine-scale topography is a powerful driver of species diversity in tropical forests that promotes species coexistence

* We evidenced possible fine scale ecological speciation  with gradual habitat variation.
* Sympatric speciation cannot be favoured over the hypothesis of a character displacement after a secondary contact.
* Does extreme competition push species into being fine-scale habitat specialists along spatio-temporally stable environmental gradients?
* Is fine-scale topography a species pump in Neotropical forests?
* Are there widespread superspecies along topography that can maintain a jack of all trade strategy (Turcotte and Levin) ?

### Forest gap dynamics are a powerful driver of individual diversity in tropical forests that promotes species coexistence

* Dynamics of forest gaps drive individual diversity and growth adaptations within Symphonia species
* Genetic adequacy with forest gap dynamics determines successful individuals reaching the canopy through divergent growth strategies, with hares in forest gaps and turtles in more shaded closed-canopy patches.
* Species overlaps of successional niches  can promote coexistence through emerging neutrality
* Does fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gap dynamics favor genotypic adaptations over species specialization (e.g. Cecropia) ?
* Can plasticity answer to fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gap dynamics within species ?
* The bold hypothesis: many canopy species exploit a wide variety of successional niches  thanks to genotypic adaptations and not plasticity.
* Trees do not always fall when the patch is “overloaded” or “mature” (symcapture), could niche-hiking species exist favoring treefall gaps with sensitive phenotypes to promote their progenies (Schwerk et al.)?

### Topography and forest gap dynamics joint effect on tropical diversity

* Topography may promote among species diversity with niche partitioning
* Forest gap dynamics promote within species diversity emerging neutrality
* Does their joint effect promote the enhancement of the tremendous diversity of tropical forests? (yes and no hypothesis)


## Limits and future directions to address eco-evolutionary dynamics of tropical tree coexistence

### Stochasticity and neutrality are of paramount importance in merging ecology and evolution in a multidisciplinary approach

* From an ecological point of view, the partitioning of niches without the emergence of a neutral process prevents the full exploration of species coexistence.
* From an evolutive point of view, considering adaptations without drift and gene flow prevents the full exploration of species coexistence.
* At the crossroads of ecology and evolution, considering niche and emerging neutrality without reproductive isolation prevents the full exploration of species coexistence.
* Overall, the lack of appreciation or understanding of stochastic and neutral processes in ecology and/or evolution is an obstacle to the development of a good multidisciplinary approach, but may result from a deterministic teaching of both disciplines when simplifying the discourse.

### Limits of local low-cost capture to study the evolution of non-model species complexes in the wild

* Introduce “lococap“ project
* Brief technical issues (pre existing genomic resources, probes design, extraction, pool equilibrium, representativity, sequencing quality, SNP call, annotation)
* Genome duplications issues
* Study limits for population evolutionary history due to local sampling of widespread species without phylogeny and range-wide niche characterization 
* Limits in detecting adaptive introgression due to sampling and methodological development for sympatric study
* Limits in detecting GWAS, major effect SNPs and polygenic signal, due to sampling, population structure, and statistical power

### Promising directions in evolutionary studies of forest tree coexistence

* Microgeographic adaptations
* Genomics of forest gap dynamics
* Overlapping generations
* Eco-evolutionary spatio-temporal scales

### Simulation approaches to address the joint effect of topography and forest gap dynamics on the conditions for species coexistence and emergence

* Why simulations (M2 article)
* Develop what have been done in modelling chapter
* Further directions

### The primordial role of individuals within species in tropical forest diversity

* Clark’s works
* Individual variation, but not species, drives growth trajectories 
* Truc et al. on how considering species without individuals can blur processes
* Individual role in species adaptive and plastic response to topography and forest gap dynamics
* Advocate for merging population genomics and dynamics at the individual level
* Build a theory of community ecology starting with individuals, because interactions with environments are after all at the individual level (Violle et al.).
