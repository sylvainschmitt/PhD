*We hypothesised individual genetic and phenotypic variability within and among species to promote local coexistence within species complexes through microgeographic adaptations to topography and forest gap dynamics.*

\newpage

## Topography and forest gap dynamics drive fine-scale spatio-temporal adaptations of individuals within and among species from two Neotropical tree species complexes.

### *Symphonia globulifera* and *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* include distinct but connected species

We identified six distinct species in the two species complexes based on differences in morphologies, functional traits (chapter [2](#Ch2)), gene pools (chapter [3](#Ch3)), topographic niches (chapter [1](#Ch1)), and growth trajectories (A1); which were maintained despite the existence of an interspecific gene flow with hybridization (chapter [3](#Ch3)). 
Genetic analyses of population structure revealed the existence of three species growing in sympatry within the *Symphonia globulifera* species *sensu lato* (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch3symphospecies)a),
previously recognized as structured in two morphotypes, *S. globulifera sensu stricto* and *S. sp.1* [@Ferry2007; @Molino2001; @Sabatier1997].
Similarly, genetic analyses of population structure revealed the existence of at least three abundant species of *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch3parvispecies)), 
corresponding to the botanical species *Eschweilera coriacea*, *E. sagotiana*, and *E. decolorans*.
A lack of power in genomics data prevented us from detecting less abundant species of *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia*. 
Species from the two species complexes showed distinct morphotypes (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch3symphospecies)b), 
despite blurred limits due to intermediate morphologies and ontogenetic effects on morphology.
Species showed pervasive niche differentiation along topography and to a lesser extent with competition (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch1SpeciesDistribution) and Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch3SpDistVar)),
notably along a variation in the distribution of water and nutrients with topographic wetness index and relative elevation (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch3soilpca)).
Niche differentiation between species is associated with a differentiation of functional traits (A1) and growth trajectories (A1).
Nevertheless, the overlap between species niches, functional traits and growth trajectories emphasizes the importance of individual variation within closely-related species within the two species complexes.
Finally, genetic analyses of population structure revealed interspecific gene flow with high levels of hybridization among *Symphonia* species (around 5%, Fig. \@ref(fig:A4introgress)).
A lack of power in genomics data prevented us from exploring gene flow in *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia*,
but previous studies already suggested interspecific hybridization [@Caron2019; @Heuertz2020].

### The history of Symphonia species in the Neotropics might be more complex than previously thought

*Symphonia globulifera* colonized the Americas from Africa ca 18-16 Ma [@Dick2015].
Despite morphological variation and genetic differentiation observed across 13 populations from Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, and French Guiana,
*S. globulifera* was never split into more than one Neotropical species [@Dick2008].
Our results are mainly limited to the local scale (chapter [3](#Ch3)), 
and further studies are needed on a broader regional scale, 
but they do support the definition of three distinct Neotropical taxonomic species of *Symphonia*.
Site frequency spectra (SFS, A1) revealed a population in expansion with an excess of rare alleles in each population,
as suggested in a previous study involving a population from the Guiana Shield and on from the Western Amazon [@Dick2008],
although @Barthe2017 concluded on population demographic  stability in the two Symphonia morphotypes in French Guiana based on genetic data.


Moreover, genotyped outgroups of *Symphonia globulifera* were used to build a pantropical phylogeny of *Symphonia* populations using `treemix` [@Pickrell2012].
The phylogeny revealed a high likelihood of at least one migration event between *S. sp.1* and the two *S. globulifera* populations in Paracou (A1).
The phylogeny was in agreement with a previous topology (S.C. González-Martínez pers. com.) with an ancestral population in Madagascar, and Sao Tome as the intermediate population between African and American populations. 
Interestingly, in our phylogeny, *S. sp1* was closer to the population of Brazil and the two *S. globulifera* populations were closer to the population of Costa Rica.
Our results suggest a possible more complex biogeographic history of *Symphonia globulifera*  in the Neotropics, 
but they call for further analyses before extrapolating.


### New insights in intraspecific trait variability advocate for their role in local adaptation and divergence of closely-related species

We found a co-variation of leaf functional traits within species (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch2PCA)),
that corresponds to the co-variation, previously identified in the literature, among species and among communities [@Bruelheide2018; Leaf functional strategy observed among species and communities is thus conserved within species.
Moreover, the response of intraspecific leaf trait variability to topography was consistent across intra- and inter-specific levels (Fig.  \@ref(fig:Ch2TWInNCI)).
Intraspecific trait variability thus widens species’ niches, 
with individuals matching their idiosyncratic environments in parallel with the niche spectrum [@Umana2019].
Intraspecific trait variability converges at species’ margins where niches overlap, 
potentially implying local neutral processes [@Hubbell2001] with a decrease in fitness differences among species [@Turcotte2016]. 
Interspecific gene flow with hybridization may maintain intraspecific trait variability through introgressions [@Tigano2016], 
thus favouring the whole syngameon.
But interspecific gene flow can also lead to transgressive rather than intermediate phenotypes [@Rieseberg2003], 
which can either hinder intraspecific variability at the shared margins of species or improve intraspecific variability at the extreme margins of species where species do not overlap.
Interspecific gene flow can also result in reproductive interference, discussed later,
with a risk for species to become an evolutionary melting pot.

### Ontogeny and plasticity can strongly impede the use of leaf functional traits 

I used genetic species identity, individual kinship, individual diameter at breast height, and plot identification to estimate genetic variance decomposition associated with leaf functional traits (A1). 
Most of the trait variation was residual, associated with tree size, or with weather (illustrated by plot effect, see chapter 2 material and methods).
Species identity had a strong effect only on leaf area, obviously used to determine species.
Genotype effect was always null or non significant.
The measured leaf functional traits were thus mainly plastic and lacked a clear adaptive signature.
Consequently, ontogeny, access to light, topography and weather (A1, Schmitt et al. in prep) were the main drivers of the functional trait variation measured on the sampled leaves.
A strong intra-individual variation in functional traits has already been highlighted previously, for leaf thickness, transfusion tissue, and mass per area with leaf height within the tree [@Koch2004; @Oldham2010],
and on leaf vein density, stomatal pore index and hydraulic conductance with shoot length [@Leigh2011].
Moreover, functional traits had no or non-significant effects on individual growth potential (A1),
as already evidenced in the literature [@Umana2019].

Functional traits have been defined as traits which impact fitness indirectly through their effect on performance [@violle_let_2007].
But my results do not suggest an adaptive signal of leaf functional traits, questioning their effect on fitness, 
nor an effect of leaf functional traits on individual growth, questioning their effect on individual performance.
This observation underlines the need to control variation in leaf traits, 
including sampling date, leaf position in the crown, and ontogeny variation in order to collect trait values that would represent the typical leaf functional strategy of an individual.
But is there a typical leaf functional strategy at the individual level?
Leaf functional traits may be mainly plastic and wide proxies, not representative of individual functions nor associated individual eco-evolutionary strategies, but may rather only represent the functioning of a few specific leaves within an individual.

Nevertheless, my sampling within species can guide further sampling among species.
Resampling 5 mature individuals with a DBH > 30 cm, as advised in a standard protocol [@Perez-Harguindeguy2013], 
I was able to show that estimation of the species mean trait value can vary from 5 to 15% percent (A1);
while the increase in the number of individuals sampled to 10 almost reduced the variation from the estimate of the mean value of the species' traits by two folds.
In addition, improving ontogeny and habitat control in the sampling help better estimate species mean trait values.
I also advocate for an accurate sampling of individual leaves within the tree in future trait-based study of intraspecific variation,
controlling for instance for the architectural development stage and the position of the sampled branch and leaf,
despite the tremendous work it represents.

### Topography drives species niche divergence

Pervasive niche differentiation along topography (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch1SpeciesDistribution)) 
was driven by tree divergence and adaptation (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch3SpDistVar)) 
within and among closely-related species within species complexes. 
*Symphonia* species specifically displayed genomic signatures of adaptations to water gradients along topography (chapter [3](#Ch3)).
In detail, species are adapted to the distribution of water and nutrients captured through the topographic wetness index and the relative elevation.
These results comfort the numerous examples of niche differentiation among closely-related species growing in sympatry, 
along fine-scale topography [@gunatilleke_specieshabitat_2006; @Engelbrecht2007; @kraft_functional_2008; @Allie2015],
and reveal possible adaptive forces at play behind these examples.
Adaptive radiations demonstrated along steep gradients in tree caldes [@Fine2004; @Paun2016] could thus occur also at a fine spatial scale with gradual habitat variation.

### Forest gap dynamics maintains individual genetic diversity within species

*Symphonia* species can grow in a diversity of successional niches with genotypic adaptive growth strategies to the fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gaps (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch4gCor)).
Fast-growing genotypes grow in forest gaps, in a bright environment with low competition,
and slow-growing genotypes grow in shaded closed canopies, with little access to light and high competition.
The fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gaps thus contributes to maintaining genetic diversity within tropical tree species (chapter [4](#Ch4)).

*Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* species showed also genotypic adaptations to individual neighbourhood crowding, 
an indirect measure of competition for light during the last three decades, and to individual growth potential (A1).
But, I did not find a significant association between genotypic values for neighbourhood crowding and those for individual growth potential, 
thus unlike in *Symphonia*, I did not find evidence for growth strategies matching successional niches.
This lack of evidence could be due to methodological issues or to the ecology of *Eschweilera* species. 
After filtering the genomic data, less than two thirds of the sampled individuals were maintained in the data set and these showed a particular spatial structuring with neighbourhood crowding (absence of positive autocorrelation on a short scale), 
which the repeated random sampling of the same number of *Eschweilera* individuals did not reproduce.
In addition, the lack of individuals and the poor resolution of genomic data may have added noise and brought a lack of statistical power.
But, the ecology of *Eschweilera* is particular compared to that of *Symphonia* with a very slow growth varying little from one individual to another (A1).
Thus, *Eschweilera* could be following a different strategy in response to  forest gap dynamics, 
through the specialization for a specific successional niche.
Or individual age is less related to diameter in *Eschweilera* than *Symphonia* due to slow growth, 
and may result in a greater decoupling of the current successional niche from the successional niche at the time of recruitment of the individual.

## Do adaptations of tree species and individuals to topography and forest gap dynamics promote coexistence within and among species within species complexes ?

### Significance of species complexes and syngameons in Neotropical forests

We tried to identify species complexes in the Paracou community based on evidence for low (phylo)-genetic resolution or plastid DNA sharing among species (chapter [1](#Ch1)).
We identified five species complexes belonging to Lecythidaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Myristicaceae, Clusiaceae, and Sapindaceae 
[@baraloto_using_2012-1; @Caron2019; @Gonzalez2009; @Heuertz2020; @Huang2015; @Torroba-Balmori2017],
which illustrates the phylogenetic diversity of species complexes in the Angiosperms.
But, all tropical tree species, genera, and families do not have numerous genetic resources and detailed phylogenies available.
Detailed genetic studies often detect cryptic species in widespread and abundant, supposedly well-known, tropical tree species, 
e.g. with *Symphonia* in chapter [3](#Ch3) or with the African flora [@Ewedje2020].
Consequently, our knowledge on the frequency and abundance of tree species complexes in the Neotropics is thus limited.
However, the identified species complexes include species that are locally abundant and hyperdominant at the regional level [@TerSteege2013], 
illustrating their significant role in the Neotropics.

The eco-evolutionary roles of species complexes and syngameons in the tropics are subject to debate [@Levi2019a; @Cannon2019; @Levi2019],
despite their recognized importance in South America [@Pinheiro2018].
@Levi2019 suggested that conspecific density-dependent processes were sufficient to explain the maintenance of tropical biodiversity.
@Cannon2019 responded by underlining the possible neglected role of syngameons to account for processes left out by @Levi2019.
Interestingly, @Levi2019a point to the lack of literature on syngameons in tropical forests while recognizing their potential importance in maintaining biodiversity:
"virtually the entire literature on hybridization between tree species is based on temperate models, often at range boundaries or on steep environmental gradients".
Indeed, knowledge on syngameons is mainly concentrated on temperate forests, and even historically on oaks [@Cannon2019a].
However, chapters [1](#Ch1) to [3](#Ch3), together with previous literature [@Pinheiro2018],
confirm the presence of syngameons in the Neotropics along subtle gradients, 
and a few studies in the Paleotropics show or suggest syngaemons in plants [@Caujape-Castells2017],
fishes [@Seehausen2006] and even the genus *Homo* [@Holliday2006].
Absence of proof is not proof of absence: our  results challenge @Levi2019a's claim.

### Tree species complexes distributed along large habitat gradients include species with pervasive niche differentiation

Fine-scale topographic variations drive differential adaptations of closely-related species within tree species complexes.
Topography promotes the coexistence of closely-related species through niche differentiation within tree species complexes.
Our genomic analyses were limited to *Symphonia* and *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia*, 
but we found similar niche partitioning in other species complexes from Paracou,
which suggests similar processes in other clades.
Indeed, chapter [1](#Ch1) and [3](#Ch3) suggest that the evolutive response is environmentally controlled, 
and should therefore be consistent outside of studied species complexes.
Pervasive effects of topography observed pantropically [@Allie2015; @Crystal2003; @Ferry2010; @kraft_functional_2008; @Lan2016], 
and related nutrients and water distribution [@Baldeck2013; @Baltzer2005a],
could drive differential adaptations between observed closely-related species, that promote their coexistence.
The evolutionary divergence could happen both in species complexes or more differentiated sister species.
Nevertheless, the evolutionary divergence seems more primordial in less differentiated species complexes [@Tobias2014],
with an increased risk of hybridization and consequent breakdown of inter-specific divergence;
while more differentiated sister species could also coexist through emerging neutrality [@Scheffer2006].

Forest gap dynamics, also identified as a driver of closely-related species niche differentiation [@Yamasaki2013], 
could drive differential adaptations among species in addition to its role in within-species variation.
The chapter [4](#Ch4) suggested a limited role of the successional niche in *Symphonia* species divergence (6%, Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch4VarPart).
But we found *Symphonia* to grow in a wide variety of successional niches (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch4ncibreadth));
whereas species exploiting a specific niche in the succession, such as pioneers, could show more adaptive divergences among species.
Similarly, abundant species with a topographic wide niche should include within-species genotypic adaptations.
Indeed, the chapter [3](#Ch3) showed important genotypic variation related to topography within species of *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ch3SpDistVar)). 
Consequently, abiotic environments with topography and biotic environments with forest gap dynamics are both driving within and among species tree adaptation and genetic diversity.

### Does the eco-evolutionary structure of Neotropical synagameons explain their local and regional success?

The local coexistence of closely-related species is governed by ecological and evolutionary processes, 
contingent on the history of speciation and niche differentiation [@Weber2016].
We focused on the competition for resources and the resulting niche differentiation in previous paragraphs [@Chesson2000; @Turcotte2016],
but reproductive isolation is primordial to explain closely-related species coexistence in sympatry [@Weber2016]. 
Species must have evolved sufficient reproductive isolation to avoid the break-down of differences and their genetic homogenization through reproductive interference [@Abbott2013; @Levin1996; @Taylor2006].
Phenology, e.g. flowering [@Gentry1974], or pollen dispersal, e.g. pollinators [@Kay2006], can increase reproductive isolation.

The way we perceive the role of genetic connectivity among species is changing, 
where species-specific adaptations may be maintained or even maximised despite high levels of gene flow, 
especially if selective pressures are spatially and/or temporally variable [@Tigano2016]. 
Species adaptations and partial reproductive isolation can be maintained despite gene flow through:
(i) linkage with an already diverged locus, 
(ii) increased resistance to gene flow following secondary contact, 
(iii) competition among genetic architectures and 
(iv) competition among genomic architectures, e.g. reducing recombination [@Tigano2016].
Consequently, adaptive introgression using gene flow among species diverging along the environment may imply species coevolution, 
or evolutionary mutualism, at the syngameon level [@Cannon2019a].
Gene flow among species can insure reproductive assurance by hybridization, lowering the risk of local extinction,
and allow species to share innovation that benefits the whole syngameon [@Cannon2015b].
This subtle and maybe fragile equilibrium between species adaptations and gene flow may be a powerful eco-evolutionary strategy leading to local and regional success of tropical tree syngameons (*Symphonia* and *Eschweilera* include Amazonian hyperdominant tree species (Steege et al. 2013) and some of the most abundant species in Paracou).

### Do syngameons shape the exceptional diversity of Neotropical forests?

We found topography and forest gap dynamics to drive diversity within and among species within species complexes promoting their coexistence. 
I hypothesized syngameon to be a subtle and fragile but evolutionary successful stage, 
which raises the question of the temporal dynamics of syngameons.
Syngameons may not be restricted to transitions toward complete speciation of the species composing it,
but syngameons may represent a temporally stable stage [@Cannon2019a].
Reproductive isolation, although partial, can evolve very slowly to complete isolation with little selection against hybridization,
or hybridization could be favored during critical environmental disturbances.
If it represents a temporally stable stage, 
the *Symphonia* syngameon shows considerable gene flow (chapter [3](#Ch3)) despite a stable environment, 
which argues for the hypothesis of a slow evolution towards complete isolation.
Anyway, as a temporally stable stage or as a transitional stage toward complete speciation,
syngameons seems a successful evolutionary strategy promoting the coexistence of sympatric closely-related species.
Consequently, syngameons, and more generally species complexes, 
could play a key role in creating and maintaining the tremendous diversity of tropical forests 
by promoting the coexistence of phylogenetically and functionally similar species [@Cannon2019].
Syngameons could participate in the 'cradle' [@Eiserhardt2017] of the tropical forest with their speciation through complete reproductive isolation 
or in the tropical forest 'museum' [@Eiserhardt2017] with a temporal stability that reduces the risk of local extinction.

## Beyond species complexes: do adaptations to topography and forest gap dynamics promote coexistence within and among species from mature forests ?

### Intraspecific trait variation importance in the forest community

The chapter [2](#Ch2) revealed consistent functional response to topography within and between species, 
suggesting an environmental control of the response.
Topography similarly affects species complexes and fully differentiated species, 
so the functional response to topography within and between species should be consistent outside species complexes.
The only limit would be a specific role of shared genetic variation through gene flow or the recent ancestor conserving the signal in species complexes but not in fully differentiated species.
Indeed, once isolated species may lose genetic diversity and individual plasticity.
But the absence of effect of genotype on functional traits (A1) 
strongly questions the role of shared genetic variation in the consistent functional response,
unless observed trait plasticity is genetically promoted [@Ghalambor2007] through recent divergence or inter-specific gene flow.
Therefore, I hypothesize that environmental gradients, 
such as topography and associated nutrient and water distributions (Chapter [3](#Ch3)), 
have a consistent effect on the variability of functional traits within and between species,
widening their niches and leading to an emerging neutrality in their overlap (Chapter [2](#Ch2)) 
for many species in the forest community.

### Fine-scale topography is a powerful driver of species diversity in tropical forests that promotes species coexistence

Chapter [1](#Ch1) to [3](#Ch3) revealed the effect of gradual habitat variation through fine-scale topography on ecological divergence of species with differentiation of niches and phenotypes.
But evolutive history behind adaptive radiations fall within a continuum from sympatric ecological speciation to secondary contacts of species ecologically specialised in allopatry or parapatry [@rundell_adaptive_2009].
Pairwise site frequency spectrum of *Symphonia* species (A1) did not help decipher between sympatric speciation or character displacement after a secondary contact.
Demographic history modelling is still needed to establish the history of the evolution of *Symphonia* [@Hoban2012], 
but broader regional sampling may be necessary for a better understanding.
In both cases, it can be assumed that the extreme competition between species in hyperdiverse communities pushes species towards fine-scale habitat specialization along stable spatio-temporal environmental gradients.
Topography has been highlighted to drive early differences in plant's life, 
which contribute to the maintenance of tropical forest diversity [@Metz2012].
Oppositely, spatio-temporally unstable forest gap dynamics contribute only a little to species differences (Chapter [4](#Ch4)).
Hence, fine-scale topography can locally represent a "species pump" in tropical forests, 
i.e. a cradle for the vicariance of species, such as the Andes on a regional scale [@Mutke2014].
Nevertheless, the species showed large topographic niches with overlaps in the Paracou community (chapter [2](#Ch2)),
which implies that neutral processes by decreasing differences in fitness also favour the coexistence of species via a jack-of-all-trade strategy [@Turcotte2016].
Topography could thus also give rise to "superspecies", i.e. allopatric taxa that are known or thought to have evolved to the species level [@Kleinschmidt1963].

### Forest gap dynamics are a powerful driver of individual diversity in tropical forests that promotes species coexistence

Chapter [4](#Ch4) showed for the first time that forest gap dynamics drive individual diversity and growth adaptations within *Symphonia* species.
Genetic adequacy with forest gap dynamics determines successful individuals reaching the canopy through divergent growth strategies, with *hares* in forest gaps and *turtles* in more shaded closed-canopy patches.
Because of the similar broad successional niches observed in many other species of the Paracou community, 
we hypothesized the process underlying genotypic adaptations not to be specific to *Symphonia* or species complexes, 
but to be conserved in many tropical forest tree species, 
probably thanks to physiological or adaptive constraints [@Ellner1994].
Nevertheless, phenotypic plasticity remains a major process that may explain large successional niches of species [@Goulet1986; @Chevin2010; @Gao2018]
that we cannot exclude until further research is carried out.
In both cases, large successive niches can promote species coexistence through emergent neutrality [@Scheffer2006], 
although forest gap dynamics also select species with narrow successive niches such as pioneer species [@Dalling2002].
Interestingly, @Bazzaz1982 found late-successional species to be less plastic to light access than pioneer species,
and @Zangerl1983 revealed more adaptation among genotypes for late-successional than pioneer species.
Indeed, late-successional species showed the widest breadth of traits and grow in more heterogeneous environments than pioneers in Venezuela forests [@Kammesheidt2000].
Together with the results of chapter [4](#Ch4), these studies argue in favour of forest gap dynamics driving genotypic adaptations with divergent growth strategies in species previously called "late-successional", which in fact encounter a diversity of light environments and competition as seedlings.

In order to study treefall conditions, I examined the local basal area distribution prior to basal area loss,
i.e. the successional stage of the forest patch before a treefall occurs.
Unfortunately, studying treefalls necessitate both large spatial and temporal coverage due to the episodic nature of treefalls [@Chambers2013].
Despite the huge amount of work behind the monitoring of dynamics of the forest gaps at Paracou [@Herault2018],
I was not able to obtain a clear pattern.
Although most treefalls seem to occur when the local basal area is high, e.g. at the end of forest succession, also called climax, 
my results could not rule out the existence of treefalls occurring at a low local basal area during the early stages of succession (A1).
These early-successional treefalls could be due to stochasticity,
but a bold hypothesis would be the existence of niche-hiking species that create these early-successional treefalls.
Niche-hiking results from genotypes favoring local niche construction [@Schwilk2002],
such as flammability favouring open spaces after a fire for the offspring of fire-adapted trees.
In the case of treefall, one could imagine the existence of an adaptation to falls for genotypes or species that grow in forest gaps.
Indeed, one could imagine fast-growing genotypes or species in forest gaps are mechanically more prone to fall once in the canopy.
But, niche-hiking in forest gaps remains a bold hypothesis that needs to be tested further.

### Topography and forest gap dynamics joint effect on tropical diversity

We identified two orthogonal factors promoting diversity and coexistence among closely-related species with different characteristics and affecting different diversity levels.
Topography, spatio-temporally stable, mainly affects trees among species and promote coexistence with niche partitioning (Chapter [3](#Ch3)).
Forest gap dynamics, varying in space and time, mainly affect trees within species and promotes species coexistence with emergent neutrality (Chapter [4](#Ch4)).
Anticipating their joint effect on species coexistence and tropical diversity is therefore not straightforward,
while simulation approaches, discussed in the next section,
can help test hypotheses on a spatial and temporal scale that experimental studies on tropical forests cannot achieve.

From a static temporal point of view, the topography and dynamics of forest gaps both favour the coexistence of species with divergent processes on orthogonal niches.
Consequently, genotypic adaptations within species decrease the risk of a stochastic local extinction while species adaptations stabilize local coexistence.
But the limits arise with temporal variation, 
which questions the origin of the system, 
the stability of genotypic adaptations to the dynamics of forest gaps, 
the stability of species via divergence along the topography despite a gene flow, 
and the strength of niche differences and emerging neutrality to avoid competitive exclusion.
Indeed, we showed overlapping niches along the topography despite niche differentiation and small species differentiation along successional niches despite genotypic adaptations (Chapters [3](#Ch3) and [4](#Ch4)).
Consequently, we do not know towards which points the neutrality of the distribution margin of the species, 
for example with the convergence of functional traits (Chapters [2](#Ch2)), 
and along the successional niches, with the genotypic adaptations of the species, 
will make it possible to overcome competitive exclusion [@Turcotte2016].
Similarly, the heritability of the topography is not negligible (chapter [3](#Ch3)) and may argue in favour of a further differentiation of species niches [@Hoffmann1999],
but the interference of reproduction with gene flow could disrupt the divergence of species with topographic niches and hinder the coexistence of sympatric species [@Hochkirch2007].
This highlights the need to further document the processes responsible for partial reproductive isolation in our models.
In addition, we do not know the stability of genotypic adaptations to the dynamics of forest gaps, and one could imagine the evolution of species, or even a speciation with barriers to repdocuction among genotypes, towards a specialized niche of succession [@Lenormand2012].
Finally, the ideal would be to be able to explain the emergence of this subtle eco-evolutionary dynamic.
We need to explain how a genotype can arise in the population to respond to the spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gap dynamics, such as, for example, the characterisation of the conditions for the stable existence of a flammability genotype in a forest undergoing fire dynamics [@Schwilk2002].
And we need to explain how species diverged along the topography with partial reproductive isolation despite gene flow, either with reinforcement after secondary contact [@Haavie2004] or with sympatric speciation [@Savolainen2006].
The preceding points underline the importance of the temporal dynamics of our system,
but we have limited our analyses and discussions to the sympatric and microgeographic scale, 
and we may need to explore larger spatial domains [@Estes2018], 
especially considering the large spatial dynamics of forest gaps [@Chambers2013].

## Limits and future directions to address eco-evolutionary dynamics of tropical tree coexistence

### Stochasticity and neutrality are of paramount importance in merging ecology and evolution in a multidisciplinary approach

I argue that stochasticity and neutrality are neglected, especially by non-specialists, 
in understanding the coexistence of species in ecology and evolution, 
especially with regard to the neutral theory of molecular evolution [@Kimura1968] and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity [@Hubbell2001].
From an evolutionary point of view, considering adaptations without drift and gene flow prevents the full exploration of species coexistence, forcing a deterministic view of evolution towards an easy establishment of species coexistence.
@Andrews2012 revealed the many misconceptions about genetic drift among biology undergraduates.
Similarly, from an ecological point of view, the partitioning of niches without considering the emergence of neutral processes prevents the complete exploration of the coexistence of species, forcing a deterministic vision of ecology towards the predominance of species niches.
To my knowledge, no study has addressed the misconceptions about the unified neutral theory of biodiversity among undergraduate students, but I have little doubts on their existence (B. Hérault pers. com.).
Finally, at the crossroads of ecology and evolution, considering niche differentiation and emerging neutrality without reproductive isolation prevents also the full exploration of species coexistence [@Weber2016].
I do not claim that specialists in one field neglect neutral processes in their field, 
but that specialists in one dispiline often neglect neutral processes in the other field, 
despite their common origin, preventing the good development of interdisciplinarity in ecology and evolution.
Overall, I think the lack of appreciation or understanding of stochastic and neutral processes in ecology and/or evolution is an obstacle to the development of a good multidisciplinary approach, but may result from a deterministic teaching of both disciplines when simplifying the discourse.
I thus plead for a good appreciation of the complexity of ecology and evolution in order to avoid neglecting the cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics [@Kinnison2015].

### Limits of local low-cost capture to study the evolution of non-model species complexes in the wild

My PhD thesis was the opportunity to contribute to the development of low-cost sequence capture for the study of eco-evolutionary processes with the financial support of the innovative LOCOCAP project granted by INRA in 2019.
Our goal was to develop affordable tools for genomic studies, i.e., a few mega base pairs, in non-model species, such as tropical trees, a necessary step for the successful completion of my PhD project.
My results have revealed new affordable avenues opened up by these techniques, including population genomics, environmental association analyses and genome-wide association studies, 
while my experience has pointed to some methodological problems that may be encountered and that will need to be taken into account in future gene capture experiments.
The first limit is the existing preliminary genetic resources needed to design the target sequences.
We benefited from diverse genetic resources for *Symphonia* [@Olsson2017; Scotti et al., in prep; Tysklind et al., in prep; Torroba-Balmori et al., unpublished], including both genomes and transcriptome, compared to the reduced resources in the more complex *Eschweilera* model [@Vargas2019; M. Heuertz pers. com.].
The cross-validation of genetic resources for *Symphonia* could explain in part the better success of the gene capture experiment compared to the one of *Eschweilera* with the resulting high quality targeted sequences (chapter [3](#Ch3)).
Indeed, the probes design of *Symphonia* was more complex and subtle than the one of *Eschweilera*.
But apart from the importance of the preliminary bioinformatics steps, I believe that the wet laboratory steps were the most involved in the difference in success between the gene capture experiments of *Symphonia* and *Eschweilera*.
The issue of read abundance among sequenced libraries was a big impediment to *Eschweilera* analyses,
resulting in lot of missing data despite low levels of reads sequenced off-targets compared to *Symphonia*.
I blame a bad balance of libraries in pools during the wet lab for this problem of the representativeness of the libraries.
Low-cost capture was enabled by a reduction in reaction volumes coupled with increased library indexing, which may have amplified pipetting errors.
Finally, post-capture bioinformatics revealed two other issues explaining discrepancies between the gene capture experiments of *Symphonia* and *Eschweilera*: sequencing quality and paralogs.
*Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* species are diploid but some include a strong signature of a past genome duplication [@Heuertz2020].
The past genome duplication may explain the inconsistencies of the SNP call in *Eschweilera* when using the *Symphonia* pipeline.
We therefore had to use a strict SNP call for the *Echweilera* data in order to guarantee the reliability of the SNPs, while favouring missing data.
Local sampling also limited the inference of population evolutionary history due to short scale sampling of widespread species without phylogeny and range-wide niche characterization.
Local sampling has been associated with the sampling of a cryptic species in *Symphonia* and more generally with the lack of good sampling of "purebred" populations compared to "hybrid" populations, 
which has prevented a good exploration of adaptive introgression with the various current methodologies [@Burgarella2019; @Gompert2009; @Pfeifer2019b; @Racimo2018].
Despite the enormous sampling effort of hundreds of mature trees in tropical forests, 
the limited number of individuals and the associated population structure decreased the statistical power of our analyses and limited the detection of markers in genome-wide association studies [GWAS; @Korte2013]
while preventing the convergence of Markov chains in the Bayesian inference of polygenic genomic signals [@Zhou2013] 
(although X. Zhou [pers. com.](https://groups.google.com/g/gemma-discussion/c/cf4Pa95aeeo) considered our results as still valid).
In conclusion, future gene capture experiments should consider: 
(i) the spatial scale, population structure and number of individuals,
(ii) the existing preliminary genetic resources and the particularities of the evolution of the model, such as past duplication of the genome, 
(iii) the wet lab protocol with emphasis on library balance in capture pools, 
and (iv) the pipeline used for SNP call in post-sequencing analysis.

### Promising directions in evolutionary studies of forest tree coexistence

Chapters [3](#Ch3) and [4](#Ch4) have pointed several evolutionary areas and concepts, 
which I considered to be under-explored and promising in future studies of the coexistence of forest trees.
Microgeographic adaptations point to a smaller and local spatial scale for evolution [@Richardson2014] 
where sympatric coexistence of forest trees occurs.
The hypothesis that evolution and ecology play at very different spatial scales may have been an obstacle to understanding the role of microgeographic adaptations [@Pelletier2009], 
but previous studies [@Brousseau2015] and chapters [3](#Ch3) and [4](#Ch4) have revealed the importance of microgeogrpahic adaptations in the coexistence of trees within and between species in tropical forests,
underlining its importance in future studies.
Similarly, overlapping generations are not exploited in evolutionary studies of tropical trees with widely overlapping generations (chapter [4](#Ch4)), despite their importance in evolutionary theories [@Ellner1994].
The chapter [4](#Ch4) provides, to our knowledge, the first evidences for the role of forest gap dynamics on adaptation within tropical tree species. 
But our results are limited to three species in one species complex, 
and they open a quantity of new research avenues, 
such as the bold hypothesis of niche-hiking species in forest gaps [@Schwilk2002].
Studies on the genomics of forest gap dynamics, need the previous underlined concepts, and may redefine the importance of forest gap dynamics in eco-evolutionary dynamics of tropical forest ecosystems, as forest gap dynamics is already recognized in ecoloy as a driving force of sylvogenesis [@Clements1916].
Microgeographic adaptations and overlapping generations played both a role in adaptation to forest gap dynamics detected in *Symphonia*.
They highlight the fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gap dynamics.
I thus more generally think that a promising directions in evolutionary studies of forest tree coexistence is a better understanding of the spatial and temporal domains of modern ecology and evolution [@Estes2018].
My PhD focused on a smaller spatial scale than usual with perhaps a larger temporal scale than usual, at least in ecology.
This focus on specific spatial and temporal domains has led to the uncovering of under-studied processes.
However, they generally lack an inclusion in regional spatial and temporal domains to really decipher their role in the coexistence of species within the Amazon basin.

### Simulation approaches to address the joint effect of topography and forest gap dynamics on the conditions for species coexistence and emergence

Eco-evolutionary studies on the coexistence of species in tropical forests are limited in forest stand inventories due to a lack of repeatability [@Poorter2016 ; @Schnitzer2016] and a lack of time to evaluate long-term effects [@Herault2018].
Forest simulators have proved useful to investigate the eco-evolutionary through virtual experiments [@Schmitt2019].
In a preliminary study, I started the development of an individual-based and spatially-explicit eco-evolutionary simulator to address the joint effect of topography and forest gap dynamics on the conditions for species coexistence and emergence.
I specifically want to address the following questions:

1. What are the conditions for the stable coexistence of genotypes and species with topography and/or forest gap dynamics in the forest community?
1. What are the conditions for the stable establishment of a genotypic adaptations to forest gap dynamics in the forest community?
1. What are the conditions for the reinforcement or speciation of species connected through gene flow along topography?

I hope to develop these questions in a future contribution, 
but I could only explore the definition of a simplified eco-evolutionary simulator based on @Schwilk2002 and @Vincenzi2014, 
including spatially explicit individuals, 
which is still far from having the capacity to explore these specific questions.
I built a one-dimensional simulator, for example an environmental gradient, and a two-dimensional simulator, for example a spatially explicit environmental matrix, with exactly the same processes.
The environmental gradient (one-dimension) is defined by a length $N$  or the environmental matrix (two-dimensions) is defined by a grid of size $N \times N$, 
with an individual growing on each cell.
The environmental gradient (one-dimension) vary from the environmental minimum value $-E$ at an extreme to the maximum value $E$ at the other extreme,
or the environmental matrix (two-dimensions) vary in a grid defined by the product of the vectors $(-E,E)$.
Each phenotype $z_i$ of individual $i$ is defined as the sum of its genotypic breeding value $a_i$ and an environmental effect $e_i$, both drawn from a genetic and an environmental normal distribution:

\begin{equation} 
  \begin{aligned}
  z_i = a_i + e_i \\
  a_i \sim N(\mu_G,\sigma^2_G) \\
  e_i \sim N(\mu_e,\sigma^2_E)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:zi)
\end{equation} 

At the initialization step, i.e. the first generation, 
$N$ or $N \times N$ individuals are randomly drawn from the previous distribution and recruited over the environmental space.
At each time step, i.e. at each generation that does not overlap,
$N_s$ seedlings are produced in each cell.
Seedlings inherit from two parents in the dispersal neighbourhood $d$.
Seedlings genotypic breeding values $a_s$ are drawn from normal distributions centered on parental means and of half the variance of genetic variation [@Vincenzi2014], and is used to compute seedling phenotypic value $z_s$:

\begin{equation} 
  \begin{aligned}
  z_s = a_s + e_s \\
  a_s \sim N(mean(a_{P1},a_{P2}),\frac{\sigma^2_G}{2}) \\
  e_s \sim N(\mu_e,\sigma^2_E)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:as)
\end{equation} 

Among the $N_s$ seedlings one is recruited either with a determinist viability,
e.g. keeping the seedling with the phenotypic value  closer to the seedling environmental value, 
or with a probabilist viability, e.g. with a random draw with probability equal to the inverse of the distance between seedling phenotypic value and environmental value.
I implemented both simulators in a web interface using `C++` and `R` with the `Rcpp` [@Eddelbuettel2011] and `shiny` [@Chang2019] packages.
The code is available in Appendix 1 (A1) and the simulators are available online (one-dimension simulator: https://sylvainschmitt.shinyapps.io/simulator1D/, two-dimensions simulator: https://sylvainschmitt.shinyapps.io/simulator2D/).
As a result of their ongoing work, both simulators have significant limitations or limiting assumptions, or even serious shortcomings, which are discussed below.
But using many generations ($N_g=58$) and default parameters in the two-dimensional simulator, 
I was able to produce two divergent "purebred" populations with a hybrid population at their interface (Fig. \@ref(fig:ecoevosim2d)).

```{r ecoevosim2d, fig.cap="Results of the two-dimensional simulator with default settings over 58 generations. The upper left sub-plot shows the environmental matrix where the individuals develop, from -E in blue to E in yellow. The upper right sub-plot shows the breeding values a (upper row) and phenotypic values z (lower row) in the matrix for 3 different generations (the 1st in the left column, the 29th in the central column and the 58th in the right column), from -E in blue to E in yellow. And the bottom sub-plot shows the breeding values a (left column) and phenotypic values z (right column) for each cell in the matrix (one line) with its associated environmental value, from -E in blue to E in yellow, over the 58 generations.", out.width="\\linewidth", fig.align="center", fig.pos="H", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ecoevosim2d.png", auto_pdf = F)
```

A serious shortcoming regarding the simulators is the dispersion. 
The shape of the dispersal kernel in one dimension is a line of length $2d+1$, which is correct, but it's a square of size $2d+1 \times 2d+1$ and not a discrete disk in two dimensions, which seems a strong bias.
Moreover the seedling inherits from two parents in the dispersal neighbourhood $d$,
whereas the seedling should inherit from a mother tree at a distance $d_m$ from the seedling 
and from a father tree at a distance $d_f$ from the mother tree.
Limiting assumptions include 
(i) the use of normal distributions that I wish to replace by lognormal distributions to better fit the models developed in chapters [3](#Ch3) and [4](#Ch4), 
and (ii) the use of non-overlapping generations that I wish to replace by a timeline defined by treefall events and overlapping generations defined by an explicit definition of individual mortality through background and treefall mortality.
Future directions include the development of proposed solutions for shortcomings and limiting assumptions and the definition of environmental gradients.
I am planning to develop a topography generator with spatial autocorrelation matching the one observed in Paracou, 
or that can vary with a few parameters.
In case of failure in the development of a topography generator, 
I am planning to discretize and simplify observed topographic gradients in Paracou plots.
Last but not least, I plan to model the dynamics of forest gaps as an extrinsic factor, 
with each cell growing in neighbour crowding at each time step,
and with spatio-temporal stochastic events leading to treefall, 
i.e. the death of individuals in the area of the treefall and the definition of the local neighbourhood crowding at low values.
In doing so, I wish to address the joint effect of the topography and dynamics of forest gaps on the conditions of coexistence and emergence of species, and to explore their joint effect on the hyperdiversity of tropical forests.
