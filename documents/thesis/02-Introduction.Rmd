Tropical forests tremendous biodiversity [@Gaston2000] have intrigued biologists for decades [@connell_diversity_1978]. 
Lowland Amazonia alone is estimated to shelter around sixteen thousand tree species [@TerSteege2013]. 
But the five thousand species of trees described in Amazonia belong to only height hundred and ten genera [@TerSteege2013], including thus many species rich genera. 
Even at the hectare-scale, tropical forests shelter up to several hundreds tree species [@Gentry1988] including species rich genera with closely-related species coexisting in sympatry [@Caron2019]. 
Species-rich genera have a higher level of genetic polymorphisms [@Caron2019] and hybridize more often between congeners [@Whitney2010] than species-poor genera.
Species-rich genera may thus result from species complexes, composed of morphologically similar species and/or species sharing large amounts of genetic variation due to recent common ancestry and/or hybridization [@Pernes1984].
Specifically, when species are connected by limited, but recurrent, interspecific gene flow, they form a syngameon [@Suarez-Gonzalez2018].
However, closely-related species are expected to share similar niche and functional strategies due to phylogenetic constraints [@Wiens2010], especially with the low genetic differentiation found within species complexes.
Niche and functional similarities is expected to lead to increase competition between closely-related species and eventually to local competitive exclusion of one species by the other. 
Despite the local abundance and regional success of closely-related species growing in sympatry within species complexes [@Gentry1988; @TerSteege2013; @Pinheiro2018], little is known of eco-evolutionary forces driving the local coexistence within Neotropical species complexes.

Niche theory explains species local coexistence based on ecological niche differences limiting competitive exclusion [@lortie_rethinking_2004-1; @weiher_assembly_1995].
The heterogeneity of ressources distribution in space and time contribute to define fine-scale habitat where species can coexist [@lortie_rethinking_2004-1; @weiher_assembly_1995]. 
For instance, topography is spatially driving water and nutrient distribution in tropical forest [@Ferry2010], leading to pervasive habitat differentiation among species [@Allie2015; Schmitt et al., in prep].
Additionally, forest gap dynamics is a stong driver of above- and below-ground competition for ressources in space and time [@Hubbell1999; @Molino2001].
During succession, pioneer species grow first in light-gaps, whereas late-successional species grow later under closed-canopy [@Craven2015].
Oppositely, neutral theory explains the local coexistence of functionally equivalent species through stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001].
Despite the role of intraspecific variability in community [@Messier2010; @Siefert2015a], niche and neutral theories often ignores individual diversity within species' local populations [@chave_neutral_2004].
Individuals within species' local populations varies functionaly with the fine-scale habitat variations [@Umana2019; Schmitt et al., in prep], allowing the species to exploit a wider diversity of ecological niches. 

But "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution" [@Dobzhansky1973].
The genetic proximity of species within species complexes question the role taken by evolution in their local coexistence.
The assumption that evolution and ecology play at very different time-scales might have been an impediment to understand the role of eco-evolutionary processes in species coexistence [@Pelletier2009]. 
Despite, eco-evolutionary processes have been documented for a while [@Tutt1896] and can play an important role on the dynamic of both species and communities [@Bailey2009]. 
Evidences exist for eco-evolutionary processes at microgeographic scale, e.g. within the dispersal neighborhood of the organism [@Richardson2014].

Closely-related species growing in sympatry in differentiated ecological niches form an adaptive radiation, such as Darwin's finches in the Galapagos [@Seehausen2004]. 
Evolutive history behind adaptive radiations fall within a continuum from sympatric ecological speciation to seconday contacts of species ecologically specialised in allopatry or parapatry [@rundell_adaptive_2009].
Few studies evidenced adaptive radiation driven by topography or other abiotic habitats for tropical trees [@Paun2016; @Pillon2014].
Despite the fact that sympatric species grow differently depending on access to light [@Yamasaki2013], to our knowledge, no studies have demonstrated adaptive radiation for tropical trees along forest successional gradients.

Moreover, ecological preferences of populations vary even within species through local adaptation [@Lascoux2016; @Savolainen2013]. 
Local adaptation can even occur at microgeographic scale [@Richardson2014] and under gene-flow [@Tigano2016], further termed as microgeographic adaptation to avoid ambiguity. 
Microgeographic adaptation and phenotypic plasiticity are the local drivers of intraspecific variability [@BenitoGarzon2019].
Topography and abiotic habitat have been evidenced to promote intraspecies divergences and microgeographic adaptations in Neotropical tree species [@Brousseau2015; @Team2013]. 
Despite the strong impact of competition and access to light on tree ecology [@VanBreugel2012], to our knowledge, no studies have explored the possible role of competition on microgeographic adaptation within populations.
