* Ignore genotypic and phenotypic variation within species 
* Ignore evolutionary forces driving past and future of biodiversity

## Adaptive evolution: from individual genomes to tree species

### Bridging ecology and evolution: ecological genomics

* ecologist often disregards individual genetic values
* geneticist are often focused on the function of genes outside of their natural environment
* genetic mechanisms that underlie the responses of organisms to their natural environments

* high level of gene flow (hybridization) [@Petit2004]

## Aims and general plan

### General

* Q: Are individual genotypes and phenotypes adapted to microgeographic 
topography and forest gap dynamics within and among species of species complexes?
* H: Individual genetic and phenotypic variability within and among species 
promotes local coexistence within species complexes through microgeographic adaptations to topography and forest gap dynamics.
* include PhD scheme here (Fig. \@ref(fig:phdscheme))

```{r phdscheme, fig.cap="Microgeogrpahic adaptation in among species of a species complex growing in sympatry. Different species $G$ grow in sympatry in specific habitats $E$ along an environmental gradient. The interaction of local environment $E_i$ and genotype $G_i$ result in phenotype $P_i$ . Phentoype $P_i$ feeds back to its local environment through biotic interactions.

include_graphics("figures/phdscheme.png", auto_pdf = F)
```


### Species distribution within and among species complexes

* Q: How are species distributed within and among species complexes along biotic and abiotic gradients in Paracou?
* H: Species complexes are widely spread across biotic and abiotic environments; whereas biotic and abiotic environments favour 
niche differentiation among species within species complexes.

### Leaf functional traits within and among species
        
* Q: How does the abiotic environment influence individual leaf trait values among and within 
closely-related species within species complexes?
* H: The abiotic environment shaped trait variation both among and within species in interaction with 
tree diameter and access to light within species complexes.

### Individual and species adaptation to topography

* Q: Are tree species and individuals adapted to the fine-scale topographic gradient?
* H: Species are delineated along topography with fixed neutral and adaptive variants within species complexes.

### Individual and species adaptation to forest gap dynamics

* Q: Are tree species and individuals adapted to a trade-off between growth and competition in reponse to forest gap dynamics?
* H: Individual genotypes are adapted to a trade-off between growth and competition in response to forest gap dynamics.

### **Chapter 5?** Environment, adaptations, and coexistence within and among species

* Q: How do tree species' and individual adaptations to microgeographic topography and forest gap 
dynamics drive coexistence within and among species of the *Symphonia* species complex ?
* H: Genotypic adaptations within species of *Symphonia* decrease the risk of a stochastic local extinction 
due to wide successional niches to respond to fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gaps; 
while species adaptations stabilize local coexistence with differentiated species’s 
topographic niches within the *Symphonia* species complexe.
