# Introduction

## Biodiversity within tropical forest from the Amazon Basin

### Tropical forests' outstanding biodiversity

The maintenance of biodiversity is a long-standing issue for both ecology [@Hutchinson1941] and evolution [@Darwin1909]. 
Biodiversity is characterized by three nested levels, from individuals through species to ecosystems.
Ecosystems hold the biological community of interacting organisms.
Earth presents a large number of terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
Among them, the outstanding biodiversity of tropical rainforests has always fascinated biologists[@connell_diversity_1978].
Tropical forests shelter the highest species diversity worldwide [@Gaston2000], 
which remains partly unexplained and subject to debate [@wright2002plant].

### Threats that affect tropical forests

On the other hand, tropical forest disturbances are increasing under the influence of human activities [@Davidson2012; @Lewis2015].
Human activities induce direct disturbances on tropical forests, such as forest logging [@Pearson2017], or indirect disturbances, such as global change affecting regional climates [@Lewis2004].
For instance, climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of drought events and associated fires [@Davidson2012] and of convective storms [@Negron-Juarez2018].
Increasing disturbance threatens many species around the world and is leading to a global and tropical biodiversity crisis [@Cardinale2012]. 
However, biodiversity itself helps tropical forests to cope with disturbances by increasing their resilience [@Schmitt2019].
Consequently, there is an increased and urgent need to understand and predict biodiversity dynamics in response to global changes.

### Regional and local species richness in the Amazon Basin

Among tropical forests, the Amazon Basin is the wolrd's most diverse terestrial ecosystem.
Neotropical rainsforests harbour around hundred thousand species of seed plants accounting for ca. 37% of all seed plants worldwide [@Gentry1982; @Antonelli2011; @Eiserhardt2017].
Lowland Amazonia alone is estimated to shelter around sixteen thousand tree species [@TerSteege2013].
Among tree species, few defined as oligarchies are abundant from local to regional scale [@Pitman2001].
Similarly at the regional scale, 1.4% of the estimated total of Amazonian tree species represent more than half of the total number of observed stems and are thus called hyperdominant [@TerSteege2013]. 
Even at the hectare-scale, tropical forests shelter up to several hundred tree species [@Gentry1988].

### The paradoxical coexistence of closely-related species in sympatry

But the five thousand species of trees described in Amazonia belong to only height hundred ten genera [@TerSteege2013], including thus many species rich genera. 
Even at the hectare-scale, tropical forests shelter species-rich genera with closely-related species coexisting in sympatry [@Caron2019].
However, closely-related species are expected to share similar niche and functional strategies due to phylogenetic constraints [@Wiens2010].
Niche and functional similarities are expected to lead to increased competition between closely-related species and ultimately to local competitive exclusion of one species by the other [but see competitive combining, @Aarssen1983]. 
Despite the local abundance and regional success of closely-related species growing in sympatry [@Gentry1988; @Pinheiro2018; @TerSteege2013], little is known of eco-evolutionary forces driving the local coexistence of closely-related species.

## Biodiversity in closely-related species

### Species concepts and their limits

Carl von Linné, considered as the father of modern taxonomy, characterised species as follow:

> All species reckon the origin of their stock in the first instance from the veritable hand of the Almighty Creator:  for the Author of Nature, when He created species, imposed on his Creations an eternal law of reproduction and multiplication within the limits of their proper kinds.  He did indeed in many instances allow them the power of sporting in their outward appearance, but never that of passing from one species to another.  Hence to-day there are two kinds of difference between plants:  one a true difference, the diversity produced by the all-wise hand of the Almighty, but the other, variation in the outside shell, the work of Nature in a sportive mood. [@Linnaeus1938]

Obvioulsy, Carl von Linné contributions were tremendous for modern taxonomy, 
and new definitions of species appeared after the introduction of the theory of evolution [@Darwin1909].
Species have been defined as groups of organisms which are reproducing isolated from other such groups, protecting the integrity of their genotypes [@Mayr1996]. 
This reflects the biological species concept based on reproductive isolation. 
But species concepts and definitions have been largely debated [@Mayden1997], especially concerning plants.
Many species concepts as be defined, such as phylogenetic, biological, ecological, morphological or genetic species [@DeQueiroz2007a].
However, tree species in species-rich genera have a higher level of genetic polymorphism [@Caron2019] and exchange genes across species boundaries more often between congeners [@Whitney2010] than species in species-poor genera.
These observations push the concept of species to its limits and force us to go beyond the pre-Darwinian view of species that is too persistent in ecology.

### Beyond species: species complexes and syngameons

Interspecific hybrids occurs in 16% of plants genera [@Whitney2010]. 
Hybrids are often anecdotic as they are sterile or less fertile than their parents, although some survive and reproduce allowing the transfer of adaptation across species boudaries [@Runemark2019].
Species that are morphologically similar and/or share large amounts of genetic variation due to recent common ancestry and/or hybridization are defined as species complexes [@Pernes1984].
Species complexes can result from ecological adaptive radiation characterised by species seggregation along environmental gradients [@Seehausen2004].
More specifically, closely-related species living in sympatry connected by limited, but reccrurent, interspecific gene flow are called syngameon [@Suarez-Gonzalez2018].
Syngameons are evolving at two contrasting taxonomic level, they maximize each species adaptation to its ecological niche, and they evolve at the syngameon level benefiting all the constituent species.
As a whole, they might decrease the overall risk of genus extinction, while allowing ecological adaptation of their species [@Cannon2015b].
Consequently, syngameon are not necessarily a transitional stage before complete speciation but may be a successful evolutionary state [@Cannon2019a]. 
Despite the key role of species complexes and syngameons in Neotropical ecology, diversification, and evolution [@Pinheiro2018], little is known of the ecological drivers creating and maintaining diversity within Neotropical species complexes [@baraloto_using_2012-1; @Cannon2019a; @Levi2019; @TerSteege2013].

### The neglected intraspecific variability

In addition, individuals present variation in performance, phenotypes, and genes within the species.
Intraspecific variability is ultimately represented by phenotypic variation among communities and ecosystems. 
Phenotypic variation will be shaped (i) by genetic heritage, through genotypes, (ii) by the environment (both abiotic and biotic) with spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and (iii) by random stochastic factors [@Whitlock2007].
Intraspecific variability is a central topic in ecology and yet relatively unexplored [@Hallgrimsson2005]. 
For instance, tree variability regarding crown size and light interception is often relegated to an error term and ignored when interpreting ecological processes [@Vieilledent2010]. 
Nevertheless several authors advocates for a better understanding of intraspecific variability role in ecology [@Albert2010; @Albert2011a; @chave_neutral_2004; @Violle2012].

Recent work has shown that intraspecific trait variation is relatively large.
@Vieilledent2010 found individual variability to account for a large amount of the variation in tree allometric relations. 
Several authors particularly assessed intraspecific variation of phenotypic traits. 
@Hulshof2010, partitioning variation of leaf traits in Costa Rican dry forest, found that intraspecific trait variability accounted for 36 to 83% of total variance whereas @Messier2010 found 12 to 30% of variation. 
At the community level, @Siefert2015a meta-analysis found on average an overall intraspecific trait variation of 25% within communities and 32% among communities. 
Finally, @LeBagousse-Pinguet2014 assessed directly functional diversity within-species between 13.5 and 33.6% of total functional diversity.

Beyond the assessment of intraspecific trait variation, some studies investigated the role of intraspecific variability in community assembly. 
@Messier2010 found a lack of variance at the plot level interpreted as a trait-based environmental filtering and an important role of intraspecific trait variability in plant community assembly.
The role of intraspecific trait variability was highlighted in community assembly shift due to environmental gradients in space or time. @Siefert2016 found intraspecific trait variability to drive shifts of mean height, leaf area and specific leaf area (*i.e.* area divided by dry weight) following grassland fertilization. 
In addition, @Jung2010 found community mean specific leaf area and height significantly varying along a flooding gradient, where intraspecific trait variability accounted for 44 and 32%, respectively of the trait-gradient relationships.
Moreover, patterns of niche differentiation were revealed only when intraspecific trait variability was taken into account [@Jung2010]. Similarly, @Paine2011 found intraspecific trait data to be more sensitive and a better indicator of both niche differentiation and environmental filtering than interspecific trait data. 
Finally, complementary studies used simulations to investigate long term possible impact of intraspecific variability on communities. @Barabas2016 models highlighted a better resilience and stability of community assembly for heritable traits. 
@Vellend2006a models highlighted the role of intraspecific genetic variability through genetic diversity on both community species diversity and composition.
Consequently, species complexes and intraspecific variability might be keys to unravel eco-evolutionary forces driving the local coexistence of closely-related species.

## Species local coexistence in ecology

### Niche and neutral theory

At the species level, different ecological theories have been developed to explain the coexistence of species and thus the persistence of biodiversity.
Niche theory explains species local coexistence based on ecological niche differences limiting competitive exclusion [@Lortie2004a; @weiher_assembly_1995]. 
The heterogeneity of resources distribution in space and time define fine-scale habitat where species can coexist.
For instance, the topography is spatially driving water and nutrient distribution in tropical forest [@Ferry2010].
Topography drives thus pervasive differentiation in habitat preference among species [@gunatilleke_specieshabitat_2006; @kraft_functional_2008; @Allie2015]. 
In particular, soil nutrients, also influenced by topogaphy through hydromorphy, directly influence the spatial distribution of forest tree species [@Levins1971].
Additionally, forest gap dynamics is a strong driver of above- and below-ground competition for resources in space and time [@Hubbell1999; @VanBreugel2012]. 
Access to light has been recognized as a driver of closely-related species coexistence through habitat differentiation [@Yamasaki2013].
Oppositely, neutral theory explains the local coexistence of functionally equivalent species through stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001]. 
But niche and neutral theory might be reconciled. 
For instance, emergent groups can maximise between-groups niche differientation and within group neutrality [@Herault2007].
In additon, fitness averaging among species can generate patterns congruent with the two theories, and are thus questioning the role of intraspecific variability in ecology [@chave_neutral_2004].
But, numerous other theories exists to explain species coexistence [@wright2002plant], in particular competition and forest succession among tropical tree species.

### Neighbours and competition

Beyond abiotic factors, theories have explored biotic interactions to explain the coexistence of species.
The Janzen-Connell hypothesis explain species coexistence and the maintenance of tropical diversity with the interactions of two effects: (i) dispersion of parents, more likely at short than long distance, and (ii) distance and density-dependent survival of offsprings due to competition, pathogens and herbivores, more likely at long than short distance from parents [@Clark1984; @Hyatt2003].
Consequently, the inverted proability distribution with distance between the two effects result in a higher recruitment probability at intermediate distances according to the hypothesis.
Other authors suggested theories focused on density-dependence.
A model of symmetric density-dependent survival reproduced similar relative species abundance distributions than neutral dispersal limitation models, advocating for the existence of one mechanism or the combination of both in natural poulations[@Volkov2005].
Moreover, asymmetric density-dependence of survival with conspecific versus heterospecific predicted well the rarity and abundance of species in tropical tree communities [@Comita2010].

### Treefall and succession

Beyond density-dependence, theories have explored the peculiar and important role of treefall and succession in natural tropical forests.
Indeed, aboveground competition for light due to forest gap dynamics is often greater than the effect of belowground competition for water and nutrient dynamics, even in early successional stages [@VanBreugel2012].
The intermediate disturbance hypothesis explains diversity with disturbance, postulating for a maximal diversity at intermediate regime of disturbances [@Molino2001].
The intermediate disturbance hypothesis advocate thus for a primordial role of forest gap dynamics in natural tropical forests [@Canham1990].
After a treefall, pioneer species grow first in light-gaps, whereas late-successional species grow later under closed-canop [@Craven2015], defining successional niches among species [@Herault2010].
Abiotic factors also play a role in the distribution of treefalls and forest gap dynamics [@Ferry2010; @Goulamoussene2017].
Consequently, forest gap dynamics strees the importance to consider temporal as well as spatial dynamics to understand species coexistence  [@Soininen2010].

### Intraspecific variability

Despite the role of intraspecific variability in the forest community [@Messier2010a; @Siefert2015b], previous ecological theories often ignore individual diversity within species’ local populations [@chave_neutral_2004].
However, several authors suggested the hypothesis or have shown evidence that intraspecific genetic or phenotypic variability promote species coexistence [@Lichstein2007]. 
Following observations of community trait shifts due to intraspecific variability, @Jung2010 concluded that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by facilitating species to pass through environmental filtering. 
In addition, studying limestone grassland functional diversity, @LeBagousse-Pinguet2014 were able to relate increasing interspecific trait overlap through increased intraspecific variability to a greater species coexistence. 
Effectively, @Clark2010 suggested that intraspecific variability allows species to differ in their distribution of the response to the environment and thus to pass environmental filtering, which would have occurred on species mean phenotype.
@Clark2010 found this hypothesis to be consistent with theories that predict a better species coexistence with competition being stronger within than between species.
Similarly, @Chesson2000a suggested that intraspecific variability promotes species coexistence through stabilizing mechanisms "if negative intraspecific interactions tend to be greater than interspecific interactions". 
In addition, some authors suggested that intraspecific level should hold evidence of mechanisms promoting species coexistence and thus biodiversity. 
@Laughlin2013 suggested to test limiting similarity hypothesis in the trait space incorporating intraspecific variability. 
And, @Laughlin2012 suggested that intraspecific variability could answer a paradox in theories of species coexistence.

Intraspecific variability might play a different role depending on the studied organism. 
More especially, long-lived species, such as tropical trees, have high ontogenetic variation and phenotypic plasticity that might be resulting of a high intraspecific variability to face environmental hazards before they reach sexual maturity [@Borges2009; @Sultan1987].
@Callaway2003 suggested that intraspecific variability, through phenotypic plasticity in response to neighbors, might promote community diversity and species coexistence, letting species adjust the composition of their population.
@Aarssen1983 suggested the "competitive combining ability" hypothesis which hypothesizes species coexistence to be based on the ability of each species to respond to spatial and variable selection imposed by neighbors.
Following his hypothesis, the species ability to answer selection promotes biodiversity through species coexistence and stabilize species composition among communities [@Vellend2006a].

### Demography and fundamental tradeoffs

Utlimately, introduced theories try to predict species demography to explain species coexistence. 
Tree demography rest on individual performance in growth survival and reproduction [@Baraloto2005; @Poorter2006; @Roman-Danobeytia2012; @violle_let_2007].
Trees' ability to grow can be measured through growth rates [@Baraloto2005; @Herault2010; @Osazuwa-Peters2017]. 
Trees' ability to survive can be measured through mortality rates [@Aubry-Kientz2015; @Osazuwa-Peters2017]. 
And, tree's ability to reproduce can be assessed through monitoring of cohorts and allele frequencies [@Unger2016]. 
Anyway, fundamental trade-off exists between performance components.
For instance, tropical trees has been shown to present a trade-off between growth and survival through the so-called growth-mortality trade-off [@Wright2010; @Aubry-Kientz2015; @Buchman1983].
More particularly, a tradeoff was identified  between survival with shade and growth in gap establishment [@Baraloto2005; @Herault2010].
More globally, some authors suggested the existence of a fast-slow continuum decoupled with a reproductive stragey to represent all plant demographic strategies [@Salguero-Gomez2017].

### Functional traits: from fundamental tradeoffs to ecological niches

To bridge the gap between ecological niches and demography, functional traits reflect fundamental trade-offs determining the species’ ecological niches along environmental gradients [@Wright2002] and shape the structure [@Paine2011] and dynamics [@Herault2018] of species in conjunction with their environment [@kraft_functional_2008].
Functional traits have been specifically defined as traits which impact fitness indirectly through their effect on performance [@violle_let_2007]. 
Functional traits can be be numerous and can be classified as traits relating to biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, morphology, and phenology. 

Several studies have related tree performance to functional traits. 
@Herault2011 related tree growth to stem economics [sensu @chave_towards_2009] and adult statures. 
@Aubry-Kientz2013 related tree mortality to wood density, maximum height, laminar toughness, and stem and branch orientation, highlighting the trade-off between so called fast- and slow-growing species [@reich_world-wide_2014]. 
@Philipson2014 found that wood density was shaping the growth-mortality trade-off. 
On the opposite, @Poorter2006 found that leaf traits underlay growth-survival trade-off, with short-lived physiologically active leaves resulting in higher growth capacity but lower survival chance. 
Finally, less is known about functional drivers of reproduction performance with tropical trees, but @Niklas2003 were able to scale annual reproductive biomass with the two-thirds power of the standing shoot biomass.

In addition, functional strategies related to fundamental demographic tradeoffs have been identified among tropical tree species, better bridging demographic and trait-based approaches [@Salguero-Gomez2018].
Functional traits covary among species [@diaz_global_2015] and communities [@Bruelheide2018] along distinct economics spectra of leaf [@osnas_global_2013; @wright_worldwide_2004; but see @lloyd_photosynthetically_2013] and wood [@chave_towards_2009].
The leaf economics spectrum opposes acquisitive ecological strategies, with high photosynthetic carbon assimilation, to conservative ones with high investment in leaf defense and durability [@wright_worldwide_2004].
The wood economics spectrum opposes fast growing to slow growing species [@chave_towards_2009].
Nevertheless, some authors advocate a unique plant economics spectrum [@reich_world-wide_2014]

## Adaptive evolution: from individual genomes to tree species

### Bridging ecology and evolution: ecological genomics

Traditionally, theories and studies in ecology focused on species ignoring genotypic and phenotypic variation within species (@mcgill_rebuilding_2006; but see litteratures in the intraspecific variability paragraph).
Consequently, ecological theories and related studies often ignored evolutionary forces driving past and future of biodiversity.
On the other hand, geneticist are often focused on the function of genes outside of their natural environment.
But “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution” [@Dobzhansky1973].
The assumption that evolution and ecology play at very different spatial- and time-scales might have been an impediment to understand the role of eco-evolutionary processes in species coexistence [@Pelletier2009]. 
However, eco-evolutionary processes have been documented for a while [@Tutt1896] and can play an important role in the dynamic of both species and communities [@Bailey2009]. 
To bridge the gap between eology and evolution, ecological genomics specifically explore the genetic mechanisms that underlie the responses of organisms to their natural environments [@Savolainen2013; @Holliday2017].

### The genomic basis of adaptation

Genetic variability is the genetic differences we find within and among genomes of individuals within and among populations. 
Thus genetic variability is ultimately formed of polymorphisms. 
A locus can contain one or several polymorphisms resulting in several alleles of the given locus.
Genetic variability always arises from new mutations inside the genome of an individual [@Plomion2018].
If mutations directly promote individual fitness through its phenotype in its local environment, they may become a source of adaptation. 
But they can also contribute beneficial alleles to the pool of standing genetic variation into the population, allowing eventually for further adaptation of other individuals from the population [@Barrett2008].
Finally, both new mutations and standing genetic variation can be transferred and be beneficial in other populations through adaptive introgression [@Tigano2016]. 
In addition, establishment of beneficial new mutations and fixation of standing genetic variation will depend on genetic drift, and the strength of selection over gene flow, besides gene flow will be partly responsible for adaptive introgressions [@Tigano2016]. 

A first step in understanding the link between phenotypic and genetic variation is to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation.
Genotypic and population component of phenotypic variation can be assessed through the use of a mixed-models, known as the animal model [@Wilson2010].
Next, a simple way to detect genomic basis of adaptation is to map variants with an adaptive phenotype, using genome wide association studies [GWAS; @Korte2013].
The major issue is to correctly deal with populations structure in natural populations to avoid false positive discovery, using tools such as mixed models [@Zhou2012a].
But phenotype are not always available, and we can try to detect genomic adaptations with the signatures left by selection.
Different models of selection have been developped and imply varying methodology to detect signatures of selection [@Flood2017].
The hard sweep model describe the fast selection of a new variant with rapid high frequency, 'sweeping' previous variation in the region due to hitchhiking neutral variation [@Smith1974].
Consequently, the simplicity of this model allows to detect signature of selection thanks to the sweep with linkage desequilibrium [@Sabeti2002], allele frequency change [@Fay2000], and population differentiation [@Gaggiotti2010].
Nevertheless more complex scenarii can exist in nature.
Soft sweep models predict multiple haplotypes with adaptive variants [@Messer2013], jeopardizing traditional hard sweep detection.
Indeed, many phenotypes investigated by evolutionist are expected to be polygenic, like weight for humans [@Zeng2018].
Finally, adaptive introgression represent the transfer between divergent lineages of adaptive variants thanks to hybridization.
Adaptive introgression might be important among plants with hybrids occuring in 16% of genera [@Whitney2010]. 
All genetic adaptations originates within individuals genome but spread among individuals and ultimately species.

### Individual microgeographic adaptations 

Individual adaptation has traditionally been studied among populations thanks to common garden on wide ecological and spatial gradients [e.g. @Dewoody2015].
Individual adaptations among populations is called local adaptation, based on the fact that local populations tend to have a higher mean fitness in their native environment than in other environments [@Savolainen2013; @Lascoux2016].
But fine spatio-temporal scale environmental variations can happen locally and lead to individual adaptations too.
Evidence exists for eco-evolutionary processes at microgeographic scale, e.g. within the dispersal neighborhood of the organism [@Richardson2014], and under gene-flow [@Tigano2016; @Savolainen2007a].
Microgeographic adaptation participate to the local drivers of intraspecific variability with phenotypic plasticity [@BenitoGarzon2019].
Topography and abiotic habitat have been evidenced to promote intraspecies divergences and microgeographic adaptations in Neotropical tree species [@Brousseau2015; @Team2013]. 
In addition, studies revealed microgeographic change in genetic structure and diversity without identifying adaptations [@Jones2006; @Audigeos2013], including effect of topography [@Torroba-Balmori2017], logging [@Degen2006; @Leclerc2015] and forest gaps [@Scotti2015].
Some studies further identified trait underlying genetic adptations to local factors, like serotiny adaptations to fire in Meditarranean pine [@Budde2014].
Beyond microgeographic adaptations of individuals within populations, local adaptations bear individual adaptations among populations.
But a strong disruptive selection between locally adapted population to different habitat may be deleterious, questionning the transition from local adaptation to ecological speciation [@Lascoux2016].

### Species adaptive radiations

Indeed, @Savolainen2006 were able to evidence a sympatric ecological speciation with species sympatry, sister relationships, reproductive isolation, and higly unlikely earlier allopatric phase.
But the latter might be hard to evidence on continental species. 
Closely-related species growing in sympatry in differentiated ecological niches form an adaptive radiation, such as Darwin’s finches in the Galapagos [@Seehausen2004].
Consequently, evolutive history behind adaptive radiations fall within a continuum from sympatric ecological speciation to secondary contacts of species ecologically specialised in allopatry or parapatry [@rundell_adaptive_2009].
Few studies evidenced adaptive radiation driven by topography or other abiotic habitats for tropical trees [@Paun2016; @Pillon2014].

In particular, species complexes can result from adaptive radiations and species segregation along environmental gradients.
Species complexes may combine and reshuffle genetic features among species in hybrid swarms [@Seehausen2004], multiplying thus the number of potential ecological niches, reducing competition among closely-related species, and helping species gain reproductive isolation [@Runemark2019].
Indeed, hybrid or derived species require some degree of reproductive isolation from its progenitors to avoid becoming an evolutionary melting pot.
Nevertheless, simulations suggest that low hybridization success among cloesly-related species promotes coexistence of species in the community by allowing the survival of rare species through hybridisation [@Cannon2015b].
Species-specific adaptations may be maintained or even maximised under gene flow, especially with selective pressures varying in space and or time [@Tigano2016].
For instance, the European white oak form one of the best known syngameon [@Cannon2019a]. 
European white oak's species lack private haplotypes indicating extensive hybridisation [@Petit2002], but show unique ecological niche with drought, cold, and alkaline-soils tolerance [@Cannon2019a; @Leroy2019]. 
The coexistence of the different species is partly due to the genes allowing their survival in different ecological niches [@Leroy2019].


### Tree eco-evolutionary peculiarities

Forest trees are a major group of organism due to their combined ecological, economic and scoietal importance [@Holliday2017].
Trees have eco-evolutionary peculiarities [@Petit2006].
Tree species have great size, long life time, numerous seeds, large effective population sizes and overlapping generations [@Brown2004; @Heuertz2006].
But tree seedlings undergo strong selection in early life stages [@Kremer2012].
Tree species have outcrossing mating system, maintain a strong gene flow [@Hamrick1992b; @Nybom2004; @Petit2004], and have a low speciation rate [@Petit2006].
As a result, forest trees present a large degree of adaptation [@Savolainen2013], and high levels of genetic variability. 
Woody species have been shown to harbour more genetic variation within populations but less among populations than non woody species [@Hamrick1992b].
Consequently, tropical trees are well suited to explore eo-evolutionary dynamics in closely-related species and their impact on Neotropical biodiversity.


## Study context: long-term study site of Paracou in a coastal forest of the Guiana Shield 

### The Guiana Shield

The Guiana shield is covered by a Precambrian geologic formation (more than 1.9 Gyr old) over 2 millions square kilometers, in northern South America from South-East Amazon river in the Brazilian state of Amapa to the West Orinoco river in Venezuela [@Hammond2005].
Soils developed from volcanic, plutonic and metamorphic materials of the Paleoproterozoic [@Delor2003], and are now heavily eroded thick and chemically poor [@Ferry2003]. 
Specifically in French Guiana, the elevation is relativelly low (Bellevue mountains culminate at 851m) and topography is characterised by numerous small hills carving out seasonally-flooded bottomlands [@Epron2006].
Precise geomorphologic characterisation of French Guiana can be found in @Guitet2013.

Guiana Shield geology and pedology compared with lowland western Amazon results in a major gradient in soil fertility directly affecting tree composition and function across Amazonia [@ter_steege_continental-scale_2006].
Indeed, soil properties, including organic carbon, phosphorous, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, clay, and toxic elements, drive forest dynamics, through tree growth and mortality, in the phosphorous-depleted Guiana Shield [@Soong2020].
Poorer soils with slower nutrient cycling have lower tree growth but longer longevity compared to richer clay soils, which are better able to retain phosphorus and organic matter [@Soong2020].

90% of the Guiana Shield is covered by tropical forests, whereas less than 2 millions poeple inhabits the area mainly on the coasts, resulting in the highest level of forest cover per capita worldwide [@Hammond2005].
Contrarily to previous expectations, the Guiana Shield has been inhabited for a long time, with pre-Columbian occupations influencing current forest structure and composition [@Odonne2019].  
Although well conserved, the forests of the Guyana Shield are subject to numerous anthropogenic pressures including selective logging, gold mining and land use change.
Selective logging affect 2 Mha of Amazonian forest per year but recover faster in the Guiana Shield than in western Amazonia [@Piponiot2016].
Gold mining is primarly affecting the forests of the Guiana Shield in South America with an exponential increase since the early 2000’s [@Dezecache2017].

### The long-term study site of Paracou

The whole PhD study was conducted in the biologically and scientifically rich Paracou field station (latitude 5°18'N and longitude 52°53'W) in the coastal region of French Guiana.
The site is characterized by an average annual rainfall of 3041 mm and a mean air temperature of 25.71 °C, with an important seasonal variation [@Aguilos2018].
Topography is characterised by lowlands with heterogeneous microconditions due to numerous small hills generally not exceeding 45 m a.s.l.
An old tropical forest with an exceptional richness (i.e. over 200 woody species per hectare) has grown in this landscape with a dominance of Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae, and Sapotaceae [@Gourlet-Fleury2004].

A logging-experiment was initally launched with twelve 9-ha plots in 1984, further filled with three 6.25-ha and one 25-ha undisturbed  plots.
Nine of the original plots were logged in 1986 with a range of disturbance intensities resulting in diverse biotic environments [details in @Herault2018].
Trees diameter at breast height (DBH) have been censused every 1-2 years since 1984.
Trees have been mapped to the nearest meter and botanically identified, often to the species level. 
Weather and climate is continuously characterized thanks to an eddy tower [@Bonal2008].
Pedology and hydrology have been finely caracterised for several plots [@Ferry2010].
Finally, airborne LiDAR campaigns were conducted for several years at Paracou, which allowed the accurate characterization of forest topography and structure [@Vincent2012].

This accumulation of high-quality environmental data in such a biologically-rich ecosystem led to numerous discoveries related to eo-evolutionary dynamics in Neotropical biodiversity.
Among others, climate have a strong impact on forest dynamics, with, for instance, drought resistance for species with high wood density and small stature [@Aubry-Kientz2015a].
Topography effect on nutrient distribution and water availability drive forest dynamic [@Ferry2010] and result in pervasive habitat differentiation between species [@Allie2015].
Water availability [@Wagner2011; @Wagner2012] and forest gaps [@Herault2010] are particularly driving tree growth.
And a trade-off exists between tree growth and survival [@Aubry-Kientz2013; @Aubry-Kientz2015].
In addition to demography, functional traits co-variations, their composition, and relation to environment and demography have been explored [@Baraloto2010; @Herault2011].
Finally, fine-scale genetic structures resulting from the identified ecolocial dynamics have also been documented.
Gene dispersal inferences suggested limited gene and seed dispersal (gene dispersal from 150m to 1200m) possibly increasing local tree density [@Degen2004; @Hardy2006].
Abiotic and biotic factors have been evidenced to structure genetic variation and diveristy [@Audigeos2013; @Scotti2016], including topography [@Team2013], logging [@Leclerc2015], and forest gaps [@Scotti2015].
But only few studies evidenced adaptations [@Brousseau2015].
Therefore, the fine characterization of tropical forest diversity, fine abiotic and biotic spatio-temporal variations, and their eco-evolutionary relationships makes Paracou a perfect place to study eco-evolutionary dynamics in closely-related species of tropical tree.

## Study models: *Symphonia globulifera* and *Eschweilera* clade Parvifolia two species complexes of locally abundant trees

### *Symphonia*

*Symphonia globulifera* L. f. is a hypervariable pantropical tree species belonging to the Clusiaceae family.
The *Symphonia* genus also include radiation of 20 endemic sister-species in Madagascar [@PerrierdelaBathie1951].
*S. globulifera* is widespread from Guinea Bissau to Tanzania in African Oldtropics and from Mexico to Brazil in American Neotropics [@Budde2013].
*Symphonia* is an ancient genus with pollen identified in the Niger delta dated to 45Ma, that colonized Americas from Africa ca 18-16 Ma [@Dick2015]. 
*S. globulifera* is mainly outcrossing, even if selfing occur, and disperse to short distances [@Carneiro2009; @Degen2004; @Hardy2006].
*S. globulifera* is pollintated by hummingbirds, perching birds and lepidoptera in the Neotropics and sunbirds in Africa [@Torroba-Balmori2017].
*S. globulifera* is dispersed by bats and tapirs in the Neotropics and small mammals in Africa [@Torroba-Balmori2017].
*S. globulifera* used many refugia during the Quaternary glaciations [@Budde2013; @Dick2008].
*S. globulifera* showed fine-scale genetic structure with topography all around its distribution[@Torroba-Balmori2017].
Moreover, *S. globulifera* has possible ecotypic differentiation with topography and wetness, with two recongized morhotype in French Guiana: *S. globulifera sensu lato* growing in seasonally-flooded bottomlands and *S. sp1* growing in drier slopes and plateaus [@Allie2015].
In addition, the two morphotypes of French Guiana have different seasonal water stress tolerance [@Ferry2007], functional traits [@Baraloto2010; @Fortunel2012a] and growth potential [@Herault2011].
The two local morphotypes of *S. globulifera* might thus form a species complex in French Guiana [@baraloto_using_2012-1; @Gonzalez2009]. 
Genetic ressources have been developed for *S. globulifera* with a published low-coverage African genome [@Olsson2017], an unpublished American draft genome (I. Scotti pers. com.), and an American annoted transcriptome (N. Tysklind pers. com.).

### *Eschweilera*

*Eschweilera* is an hyberabundant genus belonging to the Lecythidaceae family.
*Lecythis* and *Eschweilera* genera are paraphyletic and consist of three clades, including the *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* [@Huang2015; @Mori2016].
Abundant species of the *Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* in Paracou are *E. coriacea*, *E. sagotiana*, and *E. decolorans* (besides numerous others such as *E. wachenheimii* and *E. squamata* grow in Paracou).
*Eschweilera coriacea* is hyperdominant in all six Amazonian regions [@Pitman2001; @TerSteege2013] and showed high genetic heterogeneity compared to other sympatric closely-related species [@Heuertz2020].
Similarly to *Symphonia* morphotypes, *E. sagotiana* and *E. coriacea* exhibit niche differentiation with topography [@Allie2015], different water stress tolerance [@Ferry2007], functional traits [@Baraloto2010; @Fortunel2012a] and growth potential [@Herault2011].
*Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* is a species complex with low phylogenetic resolution and high plastid DNA sharing [@baraloto_using_2012-1; @Gonzalez2009; @Heuertz2020; @Huang2015].
*Eschweilera* species share more haplotypes between species than neutral expectations [@Caron2019], suggesting interspecific gene flow characteristic of syngameons. 
*Eschweilera* clade *Parvifolia* is diploid but include a strong signature of a past genome duplication [@Heuertz2020].
Genetic ressources for *Eschweilera* calde *Parvifolia* include a Lecythidaceae bait set [@Vargas2019] developed *in silico* and tested on previous genome skimming [@Thomson2018].

## Aims and general plan

### General

* Q: Are individual genotypes and phenotypes adapted to microgeographic 
topography and forest gap dynamics within and among species of species complexes?
* H: Individual genetic and phenotypic variability within and among species 
promotes local coexistence within species complexes through microgeographic adaptations to topography and forest gap dynamics.

### Species distribution within and among species complexes

* Q: How are species distributed within and among species complexes along biotic and abiotic gradients in Paracou?
* H: Species complexes are widely spread across biotic and abiotic environments; whereas biotic and abiotic environments favour 
niche differentiation among species within species complexes.

### Leaf functional traits within and among species
        
* Q: How does the abiotic environment influence individual leaf trait values among and within 
closely-related species within species complexes?
* H: The abiotic environment shaped trait variation both among and within species in interaction with 
tree diameter and access to light within species complexes.

### Individual and species adaptation to topography

* Q: Are tree species and individuals adapted to the fine-scale topographic gradient?
* H: Species are delineated along topography with fixed neutral and adaptive variants within species complexes.

### Individual and species adaptation to forest gap dynamics

* Q: Are tree species and individuals adapted to a trade-off between growth and competition in reponse to forest gap dynamics?
* H: Individual genotypes are adapted to a trade-off between growth and competition in response to forest gap dynamics.

### **Chapter 5?** Environment, adaptations, and coexistence within and among species

* Q: How do tree species' and individual adaptations to microgeographic topography and forest gap 
dynamics drive coexistence within and among species of the *Symphonia* species complex ?
* H: Genotypic adaptations within species of *Symphonia* decrease the risk of a stochastic local extinction 
due to wide successional niches to respond to fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gaps; 
while species adaptations stabilize local coexistence with differentiated species’s 
topographic niches within the *Symphonia* species complexe.
