# Introduction

## Biodiversity within tropical forest from the Amazon Basin

### Tropical forests' outstanding biodiversity

The maintenance of biodiversity is a long-standing issue for both ecology [@Hutchinson1941] and evolution [@Darwin1909]. 
Biodiversity is characterized by three nested levels, from individuals through species to ecosystems.
Ecosystems hold the biological community of interacting organisms.
Earth presents a large number of terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
Among them, the outstanding biodiversity of tropical rainforests has always fascinated biologists[@connell_diversity_1978].
Tropical forests shelter the highest species diversity worldwide [@Gaston2000], 
which remains partly unexplained and subject to debate [@wright2002plant].

### Threats that affect tropical forests

On the other hand, tropical forest disturbances are increasing under the influence of human activities [@Davidson2012; @Lewis2015].
Human activities induce direct disturbances on tropical forests, such as forest logging [@Pearson2017], or indirect disturbances, such as global change affecting regional climates [@Lewis2004].
For instance, climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of drought events and associated fires [@Davidson2012] and of convective storms [@Negron-Juarez2018].
Increasing disturbance threatens many species around the world and is leading to a global and tropical biodiversity crisis [@Cardinale2012]. 
However, biodiversity itself helps tropical forests to cope with disturbances by increasing their resilience [@Schmitt2019].
Consequently, there is an increased and urgent need to understand and predict biodiversity dynamics in response to global changes.

### Regional and local species richness in the Amazon Basin

Among tropical forests, the Amazon Basin is the wolrd's most diverse terestrial ecosystem.
Neotropical rainsforests harbour around hundred thousand species of seed plants accounting for ca. 37% of all seed plants worldwide [@Gentry1982; @Antonelli2011; @Eiserhardt2017].
Lowland Amazonia alone is estimated to shelter around sixteen thousand tree species [@TerSteege2013].
Even at the hectare-scale, tropical forests shelter up to several hundred tree species [@Gentry1988].
Among tree species, few defined as oligarchies are abundant from local to regional scale [@Pitman2001].
Similarly at the regional scale, 1.4% of the estimated total of Amazonian tree species represent more than half of the total number of observed stems and are thus called hyperdominant [@TerSteege2013]. 

### The paradoxical coexistence of closely-related species in sympatry

But the five thousand species of trees described in Amazonia belong to only height hundred ten genera [@TerSteege2013], including thus many species rich genera. 
Even at the hectare-scale, tropical forests shelter species-rich genera with closely-related species coexisting in sympatry [@Caron2019].
However, closely-related species are expected to share similar niche and functional strategies due to phylogenetic constraints [@Wiens2010].
Niche and functional similarities are expected to lead to increased competition between closely-related species and ultimately to local competitive exclusion of one species by the other [but see competitive combining, @Aarssen1983]. 
Despite the local abundance and regional success of closely-related species growing in sympatry [@Gentry1988; @Pinheiro2018; @TerSteege2013], little is known of eco-evolutionary forces driving the local coexistence of closely-related species.

## Biodiversity in closely-related species

### Species concepts and their limits

Carl von Linné, considered as the father of modern taxonomy, characterised species as follow:

> All species reckon the origin of their stock in the first instance from the veritable hand of the Almighty Creator:  for the Author of Nature, when He created species, imposed on his Creations an eternal law of reproduction and multiplication within the limits of their proper kinds.  He did indeed in many instances allow them the power of sporting in their outward appearance, but never that of passing from one species to another.  Hence to-day there are two kinds of difference between plants:  one a true difference, the diversity produced by the all-wise hand of the Almighty, but the other, variation in the outside shell, the work of Nature in a sportive mood. [@Linnaeus1938]

Obvioulsy, Carl von Linné contributions were tremendous for modern taxonomy, 
and new definitions of species appeared after the introduction of the theory of evolution [@Darwin1909].
Species have been defined as groups of organisms which are reproducing isolated from other such groups, protecting the integrity of their genotypes [@Mayr1996]. 
This reflects the biological species concept based on reproductive isolation. 
But species concepts and definitions have been largely debated [@Mayden1997], especially concerning plants.
Many species concepts as be defined, such as phylogenetic, biological, ecological, morphological or genetic species [@DeQueiroz2007a].
However, tree species in species-rich genera have a higher level of genetic polymorphism [@Caron2019] and exchange genes across species boundaries, known as hybridization, more often between congeners [@Whitney2010] than those in species-poor genera.
These trends push the concept of species to its limits and force us to go beyond the pre-Darwinian view of species that is too persistent in ecology.

### Beyond species: species complexes and syngameons

Interspecific hybrids occurs in 16% of plants genera [@Whitney2010]. 
Hybrids are often anecdotic as they are sterile or less fertile than their parents, although some survive and reproduce allowing the transfer of adaptation across species boudaries [@Runemark2019].
Species that are morphologically similar and/or share large amounts of genetic variation due to recent common ancestry and/or hybridization are defined as species complexes [@Pernes1984].
Species complexes can result from ecological adaptive radiation characterised by species seggregation along environmental gradients [@Seehausen2004].
More specifically, closely-related species living in sympatry connected by limited, but reccrurent, interspecific gene flow are called syngameon [@Suarez-Gonzalez2018].
Syngameons are evolving at two contrasting taxonomic level, they maximize each species adaptation to its ecological niche, and they evolve at the syngameon level benefiting all the constituent species.
As a whole, they might decrease the overall risk of genus extinction, while allowing adaptation of their species [@Cannon2015b].
Consequently, syngameon are not necessarily a transitional stage before complete speciation but may be a successful evolutionary state [@Cannon2019a]. 
Despite the key role of species complexes and syngameons in Neotropical ecology, diversification, and evolution [@Pinheiro2018], little is known of the ecological drivers creating and maintaining diversity within Neotropical species complexes [@baraloto_using_2012-1; @Cannon2019a; @Levi2019; @TerSteege2013].

### The neglected intraspecific variability

However, individuals present variation in performance, phenotypes, and genes within the species.
Intraspecific variability is ultimately represented by phenotypic variation among communities and ecosystems. 
Phenotypic variation will be shaped (i) by genetic heritage, through genotypes, (ii) by the environment (both abiotic and biotic) with spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and (iii) by random stochastic factors [@Whitlock2007].
Intraspecific variability is a central topic in ecology and yet relatively unexplored [@Hallgrimsson2005]. 
For instance, tree variability regarding crown size and light interception is often relegated to an error term and ignored when interpreting ecological processes [@Vieilledent2010]. 
Nevertheless several authors advocates for a better understanding of intraspecific variability role in ecology [@Albert2010; @Albert2011a; @chave_neutral_2004; @Violle2012].

Recent work has shown that intraspecific trait variation is relatively large.
@Vieilledent2010 found individual variability to account for a large amount of the variation in tree allometric relations. 
Several authors particularly assessed intraspecific variation of phenotypic traits. 
@Hulshof2010, partitioning variation of leaf traits in Costa Rican dry forest, found that intraspecific trait variability accounted for 36 to 83% of total variance whereas @Messier2010 found 12 to 30% of variation. 
At the community level, @Siefert2015a meta-analysis found on average an overall intraspecific trait variation of 25% within communities and 32% among communities. 
Finally, @LeBagousse-Pinguet2014 assessed directly functional diversity within-species between 13.5 and 33.6% of total functional diversity.

Beyond the assessment of intraspecific trait variation, some studies investigated the role of intraspecific variability in community assembly. 
@Messier2010 found a lack of variance at the plot level interpreted as a trait-based environmental filtering and an important role of intraspecific trait variability in plant community assembly.
The role of intraspecific trait variability was highlighted in community assembly shift due to environmental gradients in space or time. @Siefert2016 found intraspecific trait variability to drive shifts of mean height, leaf area and specific leaf area (*i.e.* area divided by dry weight) following grassland fertilization. 
In addition, @Jung2010 found community mean specific leaf area and height significantly varying along a flooding gradient, where intraspecific trait variability accounted for 44 and 32%, respectively of the trait-gradient relationships.
Moreover, patterns of niche differentiation were revealed only when intraspecific trait variability was taken into account [@Jung2010]. Similarly, @Paine2011 found intraspecific trait data to be more sensitive and a better indicator of both niche differentiation and environmental filtering than interspecific trait data. 
Finally, complementary studies used simulations to investigate long term possible impact of intraspecific variability on communities. @Barabas2016 models highlighted a better resilience and stability of community assembly for heritable traits. 
@Vellend2006a models highlighted the role of intraspecific genetic variability through genetic diversity on both community species diversity and composition.
Consequently, species complexes and intraspecific variability might be keys to unravel eco-evolutionary forces driving the local coexistence of closely-related species.

### Intraspecific variability

**Brutal copy-pasting from subject.Rmd to be rewritten**.

Several authors suggested the hypothesis or have shown evidence that intraspecific genetic or phenotypic variability promote species coexistence [@Lichstein2007]. Following observations of community trait shifts due to intraspecific variability, @Jung2010 concluded that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by facilitating species to pass through environmental filtering. In addition, studying limestone grassland functional diversity, @LeBagousse-Pinguet2014 were able to relate increasing interspecific trait overlap through increased intraspecific variability to a greater species coexistence. Effectively, @Clark2010 suggested that intraspecific variability allows species to differ in their distribution of the response to the environment and thus to pass environmental filtering, which would have occurred on species mean phenotype. @Clark2010 found this hypothesis to be consistent with theories that predict a better species coexistence with competition being stronger within than between species. Similarly, @Chesson2000a suggested that intraspecific variability promotes species coexistence through stabilizing mechanisms "if negative intraspecific interactions tend to be greater than interspecific interactions". In addition, some authors suggested that intraspecific level should hold evidence of mechanisms promoting species coexistence and thus biodiversity. @Laughlin2013 suggested to test limiting similarity hypothesis in the trait space incorporating intraspecific variability. Similarly, @Laughlin2012 suggested that intraspecific variability could answer a paradox in theories of species coexistence.

Intraspecific variability might play a different role depending on the studied organism. More especially, long-lived species, such as tropical trees, have high ontogenetic variation and phenotypic plasticity that might be resulting of a high intraspecific variability to face environmental hazards before they reach sexual maturity [@Borges2009; @Sultan1987]. Similarly, @Callaway2003 suggested that intraspecific variability, through phenotypic plasticity in response to neighbors, might promote community diversity and species coexistence, letting species adjust the composition of their population.

Finally, @Aarssen1983 suggested the "competitive combining ability" hypothesis which hypothesizes species coexistence to be based on the ability of each species to respond to spatial and variable selection imposed by neighbors. Thus, this species ability of answering selection promotes biodiversity through species coexistence and stabilize species composition among communities [@Vellend2006a].

### Species adaptive radiations

<!-- Species complexes can result from adaptive radiation and segregation among species in the use of environmental variable gradients, through a combination and reshuffling of genetic features among species in hybrid swarms (Seehausen 2004), which may multiply the number of potential ecological niches, in turn reducing competition among the species and helping the species gain reproductive isolation (Runemark et al. 2019). The establishment of a hybrid or derived species requires some degree of reproductive isolation from its progenitors to avoid becoming an evolutionary melting pot. Nevertheless, simulations suggest that low hybridization success among congeneric species promotes coexistence of species in the community by allowing the survival of rare species through hybridisation (Cannon and Lerdau 2015). Furthermore, the way we perceive the role of genetic connectivity among populations and species is quickly changing, where species-specific adaptations may be maintained or even maximised despite high levels of gene flow, especially if selective pressures are spatially and/or temporally variable  (Tigano and Friesen 2016).  -->
<!-- In one of the best known syngameons, the European white oak, the constituent species lack private cpDNA haplotypes indicating extensive hybridisation (Petit et al. 2002), but each of its constituent species has unique ecological preferences, including drought and cold tolerance, and adaptation to alkaline soils (Leroy et al. 2019; Cannon and Petit 2019). The maintenance of the different species is orchestrated, in part, by the genes allowing survival in their ecological niche preferences (Leroy et al. 2019).  -->
