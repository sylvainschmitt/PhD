# Introduction plan

> [color=#e0f74c]
> This is the online editor of the plan of my PhD thesis introduction.
> You can comment in the viewer pan by selecting the text and using the comment menu.
> But you need to go into the edition mode to truly modify the text in markdown (no WYSIWYG-editing).
> Don't hesitate to contact me by Skype (or other) for any help.
> Anyway, if this solution of online editing works for you, it would be great for me.
> Indeed `HackMD` allow direct syncing of the document with my GitHub account, avoiding the double integration of your comments (contrarily to googledoc). 
> Moreover, writing this note, I'm discovering that the online editor is much more powerful than the markdown editor in Rstudio.
> Have a nice reviewing.

1. Issue and general plan
    1. General
        * Q: Are individual genotypes and phenotype adapted to microgeographic 
            topography and forest gap dynamics within and among species of species complexes?
        * H: Individual genetic and phenotypic variability within and among species 
            promotes local coexistence within species complexes through microgeographic adaptations to topography and forest gap dynamics.
        * include PhD scheme here
    1. Species distribution within and among species complexes
        1. Q: How are species distributed within and among species complexes along biotic and abiotic gradients in Paracou?
        1. H: Species complexes are widely spread across biotic and abiotic environments; whereas biotic and abiotic environments favor 
            niche differentiation among species within species complexes.
    1. Leaf functional traits within and among species
        1. Q: How does the abiotic environment influence individual leaf trait values among and within 
            closely-related species within species complexes?
        1. H: The abiotic environment shaped trait variation both among and within species in interaction with 
            tree diameter and access to light within species complexes.
    1. Individual and species adaptation to topography
        1. Q: Are tree species and individuals adapted to the fine-scale topographic gradient?
        1. H: Species are delineated along topography with fixed neutral and adaptive variants within species complexes.
    1. Individual and species adaptation to forest gap dynamics
        1. Q: Are tree species and individuals adapted to a trade-off between growth and competition to answer forest gap dynamics?
        1. H: Individual genotypes are adapted to a trade-off between growth and competition to answer forest gap dynamics.
    1. **Chapter 5?** Environment, adaptations, and coexistence within and among species
        1.  Q: How tree species and individuals adaptations to microgeographic topography and forest gap 
            dynamics drive coexistence within and among species of the *Symphonia* species complexe ?
        1. H: Genotypic adaptations within species of *Symphonia* decrease the risk of a stochastic local extinction 
            due to wide successional niches to respond to fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gaps; 
            while species adaptations stabilize local coexistence with differentiated speciesâ€™s 
            topographic niches within the *Symphonia* species complexe.
