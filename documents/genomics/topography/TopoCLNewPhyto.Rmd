**Object**: Submission of a manuscript to *New Phytologist*

Dear Editor,

We would like to submit an original research article entitled “Topography drives microgeographic adaptations among closely-related species of two tropical tree species complexes” for consideration to publish in *New Phytologist*.

*What hypotheses or questions does this work address?*

In this manuscript, we investigate genomic adaptations to fine-scale topographic position and niche differentiation in closely related tropical tree species in a species-rich tropical forest. Our research is based on sequence capture data in a large sample of 663 trees belonging to six species and two species complexes.

*How does this work advance our current understanding of plant science?*

We show that closely-related tree species adapt to differential hydrological and soil chemistry conditions shaped by topography at fine spatial scale. Our results suggest that adaptation to topography contributes to niche differentiation and stabilizes local coexistence between closely-related tree species, providing new insights into evolutionary processes operating in tropical forests.

*Why is this work important and timely?*

New Phytologist has recently published a special issue on oaks, perhaps the best known “syngameon” of interbreeding closely-related tree species. Our research provides complementary insights into adaptive evolution in under-studied tropical tree syngameons and should thus be pertinent to a wide audience interested in eco-evolutionary processes.


We have no conflicts of interest to disclose. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Sylvain Schmitt,
on behalf of the co-authors
