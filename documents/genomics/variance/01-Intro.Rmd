# Introduction {-}

This book explore methodology for genetic variance estimate based on simulated and CLONAPIN data. We will proceed with following steps:

- [ ] Methodology review from litterature
- [ ] Explore CLONAPIN dataset
- [ ] Simulate data corresponding to CLONAPIN
- [ ] Test methods on CLONAPIN
- [ ] Test methods on simulated data
- [ ] Compare methods and explore biases
