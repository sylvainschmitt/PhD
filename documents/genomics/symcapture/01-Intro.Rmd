# Introduction {-}

This document review and summarize sequence capture and genomic analysis of *Symphonia globulifera*.

## Modus operandi (to discuss):

We will proceed sequence capture and genomic analysis of *Symphonia globulifera* with following steps:

- [x] Choose kit
- [x] Select sequence to be captured
- [x] Extract DNA
- [ ] Prepare libraries
- [ ] Raw data analysis
    - [ ] Genome by Sequencing (GbS)
    - [ ] Reads mapping
    - [ ] SNP call
    - [ ] SNP filtering
- [ ] Genetic data analysis
    - [ ] Genetic structure of populations
    - [ ] Genomic structure of polymorphisms
    - [ ] Ecological genomic (genotype-environment association)
    - [ ] Assocaition genomic (genotype-phenotype association)

```

## Sequence selection

Selection of target sequences is based on following scheme \@ref(fig:targets):
