# Ideas for writing

## Growth genomics

* Genotypes diversity allow complementary ressource use with spatio-temporal quick variability for NCI and growth and thus insure species against temporal changes in competition [@Vellend2005]
* quantifying effect of genetic diversity compared to other mechanisms driving ecological atterns and processes is promising => growth eco-evolutionary variance partitionning ? [@Hughes2008] => genotype effect is stronger than population effect once accounted for ? Mean species individual differences are due to genotypes and not species by themselves. Something important to be discussed here.
* another promising way is to test mechanisms driving genetic diversity => environmental associations ? [@Hughes2008]
* "Like species diversity, genetic diversity can be both a cause and consequence of ecological processes (Vellend & Geber 2005)." This is obvious but still worth noting. Indeed for NCI and genotype we can argue that NCI si shaping genotype but genotype is shaping individual survicval to NCI (chicken & egg).
* Gmax = genotype + NCI but NCI = genotype (not the same effect), to keep in mind in interpretation, it's kind of adapted plasticity !
* microgeographic adaptation through habitat selection is only feasible in the dispersal range of individuals, because they need to sample laternate habitats and survive in the one conferring higher fitness [@Richardson2014] > Adaptive dispersal
* transplant experiment for *Symphonia* (Tysklind et al. in prep) evidence selective barriers

## Syngameon dynamic

* Varying environmental conditions, species disversity and genommic diversity and look at population and community response [@Vellend2005]

## Connections between species diversity and genetic diversity [@Vellend2005]

* species diversity eclusive to community ecology and genetic diversity to population genetics
* individual processes (birth death and movement) determines both population and communities dynamics
* use the Tilman (1982) resource competition model
* at the individual level theories about species and genetic diveristy are vey similar (mutation/speciation, drift, migration, or selection apply both to alleles and species)
* spatial and *temporal* heterogeneity in the environment create diversifying selection that can maintain both species and genetic diversity.
* "Different species or genotypes can coexist if species- or genotype-specific fitness varies in space or time such that each type is favoured over the others in enough places or at enough times to avoid local extinction in the long term (Chesson 2000; Barot & Gignoux 2004)."
* coloniztion-competition tradeoffs may operate both within and among species
* beware more genotypes and more species in the same environment means smaller population size, so it can also have a negative effect on genetic diversity. In a nutshell all relation between species and genetic diversity may exists.
* genetic diveristy positive effect on species/population fitness: 1) complementary ressource use (e.g. NCI & growth), 2)  insurance for spatial and temporal environmental variability (e.g. NCI & growth), and 3) buffer against predation.
* on 14 islands species and genetic diversity are correlated at rhjo = 0.63 (Vellend, 2003)
* "theory predicts that the influence of environ-mental heterogeneity on genetic diversity may be con-strained by a community of competitors" is it the patterns observed with genotype linked to NCI but not TWI.
* "Three variables, environmental conditions, species diversity and  genetic diversity, need to be manipulated independently, and the population and community responses measured." => interesting for the modelling approach

## The consequences of genetic diversity in competitive communities [@Vellend2006a]

* modified Lotka-Voltera model with competing species $m$ and genotyypes $i^within species
* genotypic richness and range determine the probability for a species to possess genetic variants to survive in an environment in face of multispecies competition
* genotypic richness decrease variation in community composition while increasing species diversity (sampling effect ?)

## Ecological consequences of genetic diversity [@Hughes2008]

* quantifying effect of genetic diversity compared to other mechanisms driving ecological atterns and processes is promising => growth eco-evolutionary variance partitionning ? [@Hughes2008]
* another promising way is to test mechanisms driving genetic diversity => environmental associations ? [@Hughes2008]
* studying genetic variation in the wild is more complicated and harder to disentangle effects, but using genotypic richness in manipulation have the disavantage that after two genotypes the relation with genetic variance is not always linear
* experiments minimized eveness variation between genotypes
* "Like species diversity, genetic diversity can be both a cause and consequence of ecological processes (Vellend & Geber 2005)." This is obvious but still worth noting. Indeed for NCI and genotype we can argue that NCI si shaping genotype but genotype is shaping individual survicval to NCI (chicken & egg).

## Understanding context dependence in the contribution of intraspecific variation to community trait-environment matching [@Lajoie2015]

* "To the extent that intraspecific trait responses to the environment are adaptive, the importance of ITV in maintaining trait–environment matching might there-fore be underestimated"

# Regional local adaptation

## Range‐wide variation in local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of fitness‐related traits in Fagus sylvatica and their implications under climate change [@Garate-Escamilla2019]

* "our results indicate that range-wide variation in fitness-related traits of beech is driven markedly more by phenotypic plas-ticity than by local adaptation (Supporting Information Appendix S1: Table S1.4)". This include radial growth and is thus opposed to what we observe. Is local adaptation happening at a finer scale ? Are European beech to much pauverished in genetic diversity across Europe ? Is plasiticty over adaptation a better strategy in temperate climate ?

## ΔTraitSDMs: species distribution models that account for local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity [@BenitoGarzon2019]

* Table 1 is a nice review of genetic versus environemental variance estimate in several studies of fitness traits, including growth and survival. Most of the time Vg << Vr contrary to what we got for Gmax. They are using provenance = population instead of in dividual genotype. Our reults suggests that differences between population are weak but local adaptation of genotypes within population is strong.

# Finescale local adpatation

## Rethinking local adaptation: Mind the environment! [@Salmela2014]

> * Adaptive genetic differentiation is common among tree populations.
> * However, less is known about patterns of adaptive variation within populations.

There is definitively something interesting here !

## Matching habitat choice causes directed gene flow: a neglected dimension in evolution and ecology

## Scotti et al 2016 AnnForSci

## Degen et al. 2004

## Microgeographic adaptation and the spatial scale of evolution [@Richardson2014]

* "Microgeographic adaptation: local adaptation of a population occurring within the dispersal neighborhood of the focal organism."
* "Microgeographic divergence: differences in trait distributions between sam-ples of individuals within the same dispersal neighborhood. Unlike microgeo-graphic adaptation, this term makes no presumption about the adaptive value of the trait divergence."
* after identification of significant divergence, researcher need to evidence adaptation or heritability, e.g. with transplant and common garden
* microgeographic adap)aton are interesting because they are not probable under neutral processes due to the high mixing probability within the dispersal neighborhood
* 7 mechanisms (initiate or amplify): 1. strong natural selection, 2. landscape barriers, 3. spatially autocorellated selection regimes, 4. habitat choice, 5. selective barriers against migrant, 6. evolutionary monopolization effect, and 7. sexual selection against migrant
* microgeographic adaptation through habitat selection is only feasible in the dispersal range of individuals, because they need to sample laternate habitats and survive in the one conferring higher fitness.
* "If evolutionary divergence can alter community dynamics across the same spatial scales at which ecologists have traditionally under-stood them, then the need to synthesize ecology and evolu-tion becomes that much more compelling" e.g. wrong conlclusion about species ecologic interaction can be drawn from considering species as homogeneous and not locally adapted
* ecology focused on spatial scale and ecology and temporal scale > finescale patterns are assume ecological

# Syngameon

## Variable mating behaviors and the maintenance of tropical biodiversity [@Cannon2015b]

* species-coexistence theories consider species a discrete evolutionary unit against natural evidences
* simulations suggest that low hybridization success promote species-coexistence in the community
* such syngameaon may be selectively advantageous, and can be considred as genomic mutalism, decreasing risk of extinction while increasing local adaptation
* Parameters: congeneric diversity, community size, pollen limitation ocefficient, self fertilization success, individual fecundity
* Conspecific had a total success, crosses were equally fit, mortality was of 1.5%, no spatial pattern
* three steps: 1 define progeny btw conspecific, hybrid, self or fails, 2 individual death, 3 recruitment from the progeny bank
* "rare species could also become a nexus of diversification as they begin to produce hybrid
phenotypes, possibly transgressive or exadapted in a biotically and abiotically complex and dynamic environment (Givnish, 2010)."
