# Ideas for writing

## Growth genomics

* Genotypes diversity allow complementary ressource use with spatio-temporal quick variability for NCI and growth and thus insure species against temporal changes in competition [@Vellend2005]
* quantifying effect of genetic diversity compared to other mechanisms driving ecological atterns and processes is promising => growth eco-evolutionary variance partitionning ? [@Hughes2008] => genotype effect is stronger than population effect once accounted for ? Mean species individual differences are due to genotypes and not species by themselves. Something important to be discussed here.
* another promising way is to test mechanisms driving genetic diversity => environmental associations ? [@Hughes2008]
* "Like species diversity, genetic diversity can be both a cause and consequence of ecological processes (Vellend & Geber 2005)." This is obvious but still worth noting. Indeed for NCI and genotype we can argue that NCI si shaping genotype but genotype is shaping individual survicval to NCI (chicken & egg).
* Gmax = genotype + NCI but NCI = genotype (not the same effect), to keep in mind in interpretation, it's kind of adapted plasticity !
* microgeographic adaptation through habitat selection is only feasible in the dispersal range of individuals, because they need to sample laternate habitats and survive in the one conferring higher fitness [@Richardson2014] > Adaptive dispersal
* transplant experiment for *Symphonia* (Tysklind et al. in prep) evidence selective barriers

## Connections between species diversity and genetic diversity [@Vellend2005]

* species diversity eclusive to community ecology and genetic diversity to population genetics
* individual processes (birth death and movement) determines both population and communities dynamics
* use the Tilman (1982) resource competition model
* at the individual level theories about species and genetic diveristy are vey similar (mutation/speciation, drift, migration, or selection apply both to alleles and species)
* spatial and *temporal* heterogeneity in the environment create diversifying selection that can maintain both species and genetic diversity.
* "Different species or genotypes can coexist if species- or genotype-specific fitness varies in space or time such that each type is favoured over the others in enough places or at enough times to avoid local extinction in the long term (Chesson 2000; Barot & Gignoux 2004)."
* coloniztion-competition tradeoffs may operate both within and among species
* beware more genotypes and more species in the same environment means smaller population size, so it can also have a negative effect on genetic diversity. In a nutshell all relation between species and genetic diversity may exists.
* genetic diveristy positive effect on species/population fitness: 1) complementary ressource use (e.g. NCI & growth), 2)  insurance for spatial and temporal environmental variability (e.g. NCI & growth), and 3) buffer against predation.
* on 14 islands species and genetic diversity are correlated at rhjo = 0.63 (Vellend, 2003)
* "theory predicts that the influence of environ-mental heterogeneity on genetic diversity may be con-strained by a community of competitors" is it the patterns observed with genotype linked to NCI but not TWI.
* "Three variables, environmental conditions, species diversity and  genetic diversity, need to be manipulated independently, and the population and community responses measured." => interesting for the modelling approach

## The consequences of genetic diversity in competitive communities [@Vellend2006a]

* modified Lotka-Voltera model with competing species $m$ and genotyypes $i^within species
* genotypic richness and range determine the probability for a species to possess genetic variants to survive in an environment in face of multispecies competition
* genotypic richness decrease variation in community composition while increasing species diversity (sampling effect ?)

## Ecological consequences of genetic diversity [@Hughes2008]

* quantifying effect of genetic diversity compared to other mechanisms driving ecological atterns and processes is promising => growth eco-evolutionary variance partitionning ? [@Hughes2008]
* another promising way is to test mechanisms driving genetic diversity => environmental associations ? [@Hughes2008]
* studying genetic variation in the wild is more complicated and harder to disentangle effects, but using genotypic richness in manipulation have the disavantage that after two genotypes the relation with genetic variance is not always linear
* experiments minimized eveness variation between genotypes
* "Like species diversity, genetic diversity can be both a cause and consequence of ecological processes (Vellend & Geber 2005)." This is obvious but still worth noting. Indeed for NCI and genotype we can argue that NCI si shaping genotype but genotype is shaping individual survicval to NCI (chicken & egg).

## Coexistence in a variable environment: Eco-evolutionary perspectives

## Eco-evolutionary dynamics enable coexistence via neighbor-dependent selection [@Vasseur2011]

* Unsuccessful theory of species coexistence compared to data suggest that ecological factors may not be enough => individual and population genetic
* neighbor-dependent selection is not linked to the niche and connaot allow coexistence without evolution, thus it could improve coexistence where cology is not sufficient
* sp coexistence could be improved by seleciton of interspecific competition for rare species and intraspecific competition for abundant species
* mustard trade-off btw growth for intraspecific competition and toxicity for interspecific competition
* Meth: Lotka-Voltera + function to vary competition coefficient a + breeder equation to make this coefficient evolve
* shifumi :
    * var sp + hetero > fixed sp
    * fixed sp > var sp + con
    * var sp con > ind sp con

## Adaptation and habitat selection in the eco-evolutionary process [@Morris2011]

* Biodiversity prediction for biodiversity lost rest on ecophysiology, phenology, and species dsitribution but we lack eco-evolutionary insights besides intertwined
* Moris & Lundlberg 2011's 6 pillars of evolution:
    * Mechanics = genetic and non genetic origins of traits, phenotype and strategies
    * Functions = evolutionary value of the trait modifying reproduction and survival
    * Structure = trait, strategies and functions interaction ith the environment
    * Scales = time, space, and biological organization
    * Dynamic = change of alleles, traits and strategy
    * Adaptation = fit between form and function => diversity and coexistence
* eco-evo theory difficult because traits & genetic feedback at different scales + stochasticity
* Possibility for individual to settle in optimal fitness habitat or not, e.g. tree are dispersed but at fine scale we may hypothesize that among seed rain some will fall in the habitat of interest
* + density => - fitness = + NCI => -Gmax ?
* Habitat occupation = porportional use of different habitat by individuals within a population => interesting concept => genetic or behavioural
* Individual fitness w_i vs population fitness E(w_i)
* Fitness evolution quicker at high density e.g. seedlings recruits
* Plateau (TWI -) diminish negative effect of density (NCI) on fitness (Gmax) ?
* current general theories assume fixed habitats and identical individuals, ignoring much of habitat selection prcesses
* individual = habitat availability > population = home range > species = geographical range
* Fine grained environment yeld habitat use by individuals proptrionaly to its availability and maximise potential gene flow
* Habitat preference can be understood only in the light of population dynamics (density) and adaptive (fitness-maximizing) choice => this justify our whole study
* At coarser environmental grain adapted individual mixing to gene pool before recruitment lead to gene flow leading local adaptation proportionnaly to the production of descendants per habitat
* Adaptation is the key linking ecology and evolution of habitat selection
* Habitat selection strategy must be (i) convergence stable, (ii) resist invasion, (iii) be able to invade when rare
* Inferring real adaptive landscape between habitat, population density, and individual fitness could allow to forecast future adaptation to habitat changes
* At low density every strategy yeld similar high fitness whereas at high density subotpimal strategies are replaced by more adapted individuals
* Low density => flat adaptive landscape or a lot of strategy yeld high fitness => more drift on which selection can thereafter play at higher density
* All the 6 concepts (mechanisms, functional relationships, structure, scale, dynamics and adaptation) relation to be integrated to explore our eco-evolutionary system

# Evolutionary dynamics

## Role of overlapping generations in maintaining genetic variation in a fluctuating environment [@Ellner1994]

They develop the idea that temporally fluctuating selection can maintain genetic variation of overlapping generations with age- or stade-specific selection. This is due to the storage effect (Chesson 1983): an organism may experience reduced or loss of recruitment in bad years but can persist long enough to have viable favorables periods. A key feature of the model is the presence of a life-history stage immune to the environmental fluctuations allowing the storage effect. It is the storage of genotypes in long-lived stages on which the fluctuating selection does not act that provides the mechanism for maintenance of polymorphism. In a nutshell, a short-lived adult with few opportunities to reproduce must bet on the average, while a long-lived adult can play a riskier strategy with occasional big payoffs. Consequently, genetic variance will be maintained if selection is intense and there is a high level of generational overlap, and genetic variance will be lost if selection is too weak or there is too little overlap. Nevertheless, genetic variation is expected, but only so long as a mixed-strategy bet hedger is absent.Thus, mixed-strategy bet hedging must be prevented by some constraint against it such as physiological cost or inherent complexity of the proposed adaptation? Populations with high genetic variation are thus capable of significant changes in gene frequencies in response to short-term changes in selection.

In our case, we indeed have Symphonia trees with a huge selection by competition and growth at young stages but canopy trees more immune to competition that can act as a long-live storage of genotypes. Generations are effectively broadly overlapping with a mean effective generation of 60 years (what was your reference Bruno ?) but adult lifespan is way longer (even centuries for some of them). And seed dormancy could even bring an additional storage stage. Finally, it seems reasonable to discuss the fact that physiological cost or complexity of functional strategic adaptation prevent the existence of a phenotype with mixed-strategy to respond to the successional niches brought by forest gap dynamics.

## Fighting change with change: Adaptive variation in an uncertain world [@Meyers2002]

# Regional local adaptation

## Range‐wide variation in local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of fitness‐related traits in Fagus sylvatica and their implications under climate change [@Garate-Escamilla2019]

* "our results indicate that range-wide variation in fitness-related traits of beech is driven markedly more by phenotypic plas-ticity than by local adaptation (Supporting Information Appendix S1: Table S1.4)". This include radial growth and is thus opposed to what we observe. Is local adaptation happening at a finer scale ? Are European beech to much pauverished in genetic diversity across Europe ? Is plasiticty over adaptation a better strategy in temperate climate ?

## ΔTraitSDMs: species distribution models that account for local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity [@BenitoGarzon2019]

* Table 1 is a nice review of genetic versus environemental variance estimate in several studies of fitness traits, including growth and survival. Most of the time Vg << Vr contrary to what we got for Gmax. They are using provenance = population instead of in dividual genotype. Our reults suggests that differences between population are weak but local adaptation of genotypes within population is strong.

# Finescale local adpatation

## Rethinking local adaptation: Mind the environment! [@Salmela2014]

> * Adaptive genetic differentiation is common among tree populations.
> * However, less is known about patterns of adaptive variation within populations.

There is definitively something interesting here !

## Microgeographic adaptation and the spatial scale of evolution [@Richardson2014]

* "Microgeographic adaptation: local adaptation of a population occurring within the dispersal neighborhood of the focal organism."
* "Microgeographic divergence: differences in trait distributions between sam-ples of individuals within the same dispersal neighborhood. Unlike microgeo-graphic adaptation, this term makes no presumption about the adaptive value of the trait divergence."
* after identification of significant divergence, researcher need to evidence adaptation or heritability, e.g. with transplant and common garden
* microgeographic adap)aton are interesting because they are not probable under neutral processes due to the high mixing probability within the dispersal neighborhood
* 7 mechanisms (initiate or amplify): 1. strong natural selection, 2. landscape barriers, 3. spatially autocorellated selection regimes, 4. habitat choice, 5. selective barriers against migrant, 6. evolutionary monopolization effect, and 7. sexual selection against migrant
* microgeographic adaptation through habitat selection is only feasible in the dispersal range of individuals, because they need to sample laternate habitats and survive in the one conferring higher fitness.
* "If evolutionary divergence can alter community dynamics across the same spatial scales at which ecologists have traditionally under-stood them, then the need to synthesize ecology and evolu-tion becomes that much more compelling" e.g. wrong conlclusion about species ecologic interaction can be drawn from considering species as homogeneous and not locally adapted
* ecology focused on spatial scale and ecology and temporal scale > finescale patterns are assume ecological

# Syngameon

* species-coexistence theories consider species a discrete evolutionary unit against natural evidences
* simulations suggest that low hybridization success promote species-coexistence in the community
* such syngameaon may be selectively advantageous, and can be considred as genomic mutalism, decreasing risk of extinction while increasing local adaptation
* Parameters: congeneric diversity, community size, pollen limitation ocefficient, self fertilization success, individual fecundity
* Conspecific had a total success, crosses were equally fit, mortality was of 1.5%, no spatial pattern
* three steps: 1 define progeny btw conspecific, hybrid, self or fails, 2 individual death, 3 recruitment from the progeny bank
* "rare species could also become a nexus of diversification as they begin to produce hybrid
phenotypes, possibly transgressive or exadapted in a biotically and abiotically complex and dynamic environment (Givnish, 2010)."
