# Introduction

Objectives of the analysis:

* explain variations in leaf traits of individuals from different species complexes according to 4 descriptors: (i) tree ontogeny, (ii) biotic interactions and (iii) abiotic environment, and (iv) phylogeny through taxonomic levels.
* explore trades-off between traits among complexes

# Material & Methods

## Study site 

The study was conducted in the northernmost part of the Guiana Plateau region, at the Paracou field station. The site was characterized by an average of 3041mm annual rainfall and a mean air temperature of 25.71°C. Old tropical forest with an exceptional richness (over 750 woody species) has developed among the succession of small hills of this area, rising to 10–40 m a.s.l. (_Gourlet-Fleury et al., 2004_). 

The site is made of 16 permanent plots (fifteen 6.25 ha plus one 25 ha) which have been censused (DBH>10) every 1-2 years for more than 35 years. Nine of the plots were logged and subjected to human-induced disturbance in 1986.


## Individuals sampling

Two sampling campaigns were led in 2017 and 2018 during dry season. Sampling was made over two hyper-dominant species complexes (_ Hyperdominance in the Amazonian Tree Flora_ ): (i) *Symphonia globulifera* and (ii) *Eschweilera clade Parvifolia*. Respectively 2 and 14 species of each were selected, and sampled on several individuals, depending on their natural abundance within the site.
*Symphonia globulifera* were collected over all plots of the station for abundance matters, whereas *Eschweilera clade Parvifolia* were sampled only non-disturbed plots. 838 trees were collected in total (Table \@ref(tab:Ndata). 
For each individual, 5 mature and healthy leaves in consistent light conditions were collected, and kept in humidified ziplock with enriched CO2 air in dark until measurement within the next 10 hours following standardized protocol (_N. Pérez-Harguindeguy et al, 2013_).
 
```{r Ndata, fig.cap="Species headcount",fig.width=12}
Individuals %>% 
  group_by(Genus, Species) %>% 
  summarise(N = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Genus), desc(N)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Number of individuals per species and genus.", escape = F) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  collapse_rows(columns = 1)
``` 

## Trait measurements

After sampling, trait measurements were led on fresh leaves: (i) leaf area, (ii) leaf thickness (3 repetitions), (iii) leaf fresh weight and (iv) SPAD (3 repetitions). Leaves were then dried during 48h at 85°C and dry weight was measured.
Based on these direct measures, 5 functional traits were computed (Table \@ref(tab:Traits)).
Chlorophyll contents was assessed using both an allometric model calibrated specifically on *Symphonia globulifera* and a general allometric model for neotropical trees for *Eschweilera clade Parvifolia* (Coste et al. 2010).
Leaf traits were averaged by individual for subsequent analysis. Leaf Thickness, Leaf Area and Specific Leaf Area were not measured on all leaves sampled for technical concerns, dataset was consequently truncated for those traits.

```{r Traits, fig.cap="Functional traits measured, with trait unit, and abbreviation."}
data.frame(
  Traits = c("Specific Leaf Area", "Leaf Dry Matter Content", "Leaf Thickness", "Leaf Area", 
             "Chlorophyll Content"),
  #"Branch Bark Thickness" , "Branch Bark Density", "Branch Wood Density "),
  Unit = c("$cm^2.g^{-1}$","$g·g^{-1}$","$\\mu m$","$cm^2$", "$g.cm^{-2}$"),
  #,"$mm$","$g.cm^{-3}$","$g.cm^{-3}$"),
  Abbreviation = c("SLA", "LDMC","LT", "LA", "CC")) %>% 
  #"brBT", "brBD", "brWD")) %>% 
  #Formula = c("Area/Dry Mass","Fresh Mass/Dry Mass", "None","None","None","jsp","jsp","jsp")) %>% 
  kable(format = "pandoc", escape = F,
        caption = "Functional traits measured, with trait unit, and abbreviation.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", full_width = T)
```

## Environmental variables
 
Environmental and ontogenetic descriptors were chosen for building a model explaining individuals phenotype. They were selected in order to minimize their covariations (Figure \@ref(fig:Descriptors), and see supplementary material A02-Environment).
Diameter at breast height (DBH) was chosen as an indirect proxy for both light access and ontogeny effect. 
A neighbor crowding index (NCI; Uriarte et al. 2004) was used as a descriptor of biotic asymmetric competition through tree neighborhood, implying that other biotic effects, as herbivory and pathogens effects, were not taken into account.The neighborhood crowding index $NCI_i$ from tree individual $i$ was calculated with the following formula:

$$NCI_i = \sum _{j~|~\delta_{i,j}<\delta_{max}} ^{J_i} DBHj^\beta e^{-\alpha*\delta_{i,j}} ~|~ \begin{bmatrix} \beta \\ \alpha \\ \delta_{max} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 20 \end{bmatrix}$$

with $DBH_j$ the diameter from neighboring tree $j$ and $\delta_{i,j}$ its distance to individual tree $i$. $NCI_i$ is computed for all neighbors at a distance $\delta_{i,j}$ inferior to maximum neighboring distance $\delta_{max}$. $\beta$ represents the power of neighbors $DBH$ effect, set to 2 to consider neighbors surface. $\alpha$ represents the decrease of neighbors $DBH$ effect with distance (note that $\alpha$ set to 0 represent local basal area). $\delta_{max}$ represents the neighboring radius considered for $NCI$, here set to 20 meters as often observed in literature.
Finally, topographic wetness index (TWI) was selected between various abiotic descriptors available (see supplementary material A02-Environment) and highlighted water accumulation areas, which is crucial information at local scale when it comes to tropical ecosystems [@ferry2010higher].

Descriptors used were measured on the field (DBH), derived from field measures (NCI) or derived from a 1-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) built using LiDAR campaign done in 2015 (TWI).

## Analysis

### Traits co-variations
First, individual traits co-variation were investigated by principal component analysis (PCA) on each species complexes. 

### Phenotype determinants
Each traits were plotted according to selected descriptors and enabled to assess a submodel shape for abiotic environment, biotic environment and ontogeny effects (see Supplementary Material A03-Models). Submodels were compiled in the following additive model: 

\begin{equation} 
T_{c,s,i} \sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha_{c,s}.\frac{DBH_i}{{\beta_{DBH}}_{c,s} + DBH_i} + {\beta_{TWI}}_{c,s}.TWI_i + {\beta_{Comp}}_{c,s}.\sum_{j=1}^{J_i} DBH_j^{2} . e^{-\alpha_{NCI}.\delta_{i,j}}, \sigma^2)    \\
  \Theta_{c,s} \sim \mathcal{N}^4(\Theta_c,\sigma^2_{species}) ~|~ \Theta =
   \begin{bmatrix}
           \alpha \\
           \beta_{DBH} \\
           \beta_{TWI} \\
           \beta_{Comp} \\
  \end{bmatrix},~\sigma^2_{species}
  \begin{bmatrix}
           \sigma^2_{Intercept} \\
           \sigma^2_{DBH} \\
           \sigma^2_{TWI} \\
           \sigma^2_{Comp} \\
  \end{bmatrix}  \\
  \Theta_c \sim \mathcal{N}^{4}(0, + \infty) \\
  (\alpha_{NCI},\sigma^2, \sigma^2_{species}) \sim \Gamma^{6}(- \infty, + \infty)
(\#eq:final)
\end{equation}
with $Trait_{c,s,i}$ being a foliar trait of an individual i, from the species s, and the complex c. $i$ ranges $[1,I_s]$ where $I_s$ is the number of individuals in species s; $s$ ranges in $[1,S_c]$ where $S_c$ is the number of species in complex c and $c$ in $[1,C]$ where $C$ is the number of complexes.

#### Ontogeny

The ontogenic effect on traits is represented by the term $\frac{DBH_i}{{\beta_{DBH}}_{c,s} + DBH_i}$, which is a Michaelis-Menten form, where $DBH_i$ was the DBH of the individual $i$. $\beta_{DBH}$  is the value of DBH for which the trait account for half of its saturation value. With higher $\beta_{DBH}$, traits evolves slowlier towards its plateau, consequently, ontogeny affects more traits values. Thus, $\beta_{DBH}$ ranges in positive values. 

#### Abiotic environment

The effect of abiotic environment relies on the topographic wetness index and is represented in the model by the following linear term: ${\beta_{TWI}}_{c,s}.TWI_i$. $TWI_i$ is the value of TWI for the individual $i$ and  ${\beta_{TWI}}_{c,s}$ is the slope of TWI effect, e.g. taking positive ${\beta_{TWI}}_{c,s}$ represents an increase of the trait value with water accumulation.


#### Biotic environment

The effect of competition is assessed by NCI through the following part: ${\beta_{Comp}}_{c,s}.\sum_{j=1}^{J_i} DBH_j^{2} . e^{-\alpha_{NCI}.\delta_{i,j}}$ , with $j$ ranging in $[1,J_i]$ where $J_i$ is the number of neighbors within the area of diameter $\delta_{max}$ surrounding the individual i, and $DBH_j$ the value of $DBH$ for neighbor $j$. $\delta_{i,j}$ is the distance between the individual i and one of its neighbors j. $\alpha_{NCI}$ represents the effect of neighbors distance to the individual $i$. Lower $\alpha_{NCI}$ enable to strengthen competition effects from more distant trees.  With $\alpha_{NCI}$ set to 1, neighbors DBH have only an effect of 0.1% after 2.3 meters, what displayed therefore that it has to explore values close to zero, but positive. $\beta_{Comp}$ is the slope of competition effect, e.g. negative $\beta_{Comp}$ highlight a decrease of trait value with competition.


#### Additive model and mixed effects

Assuming first that interactions between descriptors were negligible, each descriptors effects were summed in a general additive model. A parameter $alpha$ was added to represent the intercept of the model, i.e. when ontogeny, abiotic and biotic environment do not affect phenotype, traits values reach the $alpha$ value, the saturation plateau.

Moreover, individuals displayed different trends depending on complex and species they belonged to. It was chosen to deal with complexes as fixed effect on parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta_{DBH}$, $\beta_{TWI}$ and $\beta_{Comp}$) because they were represented only by two levels ($C=2$), and we looked at complex differentiation by investigating overlap of parameters posteriors. In addition, species were integrated as random effect on parameters for all individuals. Therefore, $\sigma^2_{species}$ (i.e. $\sigma^2_{Intercept}$, $\sigma^2_{DBH}$, $\sigma^2_{TWI}$ and $\sigma^2_{Comp}$) represents parameters variance for species random effect.
Finally $\sigma^2$ was the residual standard error, and represented variability of traits that could not be explained by the model, namely the unexplained remaining part, the effect of variability among leaves sampled, measures errors and random stochastic factors. 


Traits, DBH and TWI were all reduced for the model inference, in order to make it easier to compare strength of effects between traits and between effects. A Bayesian approach (see supplementary material A07-Additive) was used to infer parameters of the model regarding each foliar traits, in order to then analyze effects of abiotic environment, biotic interactions, and ontogeny on phenotype, and to quantify variability of traits caused by different taxonomic levels.

> **Because of Bayesian inferences are still in progress, subsequent analysis will be constructed omitting competition effect**

# Results

## Co-variations of traits among complexes

Within *Symphonia globulifera* complex, 75.1% of total variance was conserved on the two first axis from the PCA of leaf traits (figure \@ref(fig:PCAsympho)). The first axis mainly increased with SLA and decreased with LDMC and CC, i.e. while SLA increased, leaf dry matter and chlorophyll diminished. Nevertheless the weights of the two remaining variables (LA and LT) on this axis were also significant. The first axis highlighted a strong correlation between CC and LDMC, whereas SLA and LA were still decoupled. The second axis was more related with LT and LA. The two morphotypes (*S. sp1* and *S. globulifera*) were segregated along the second axis, with decreasing LT and LA from *S. globulifera* to *S. sp1*. Finally, with decreasing diameter, SLA and LA increased whereas dry matter, chlorophyll content and leaf thickness lessen.

Within *Eschweilera clade Parvifolia* complex, 65.16% of total variance was conserved on the two first axis from the PCA of leaf traits (figure \@ref(fig:PCAeschw)). The opposition of increasing SLA with low LT and LDMC mostly draw the first axis of PCA. The second axis was related to increasing CC and LA, which were well correlated. SLA and LA seem had a decoupled relations. In addition, the first axis significantly segregated *E sagotiana* from other species (supplementary material A01-PCA), mostly investing in a thick leaves with high dry matter content but with low SLA . Whereas the second axis significantly segregated two species pools, *E. decolorans*, *E. sagotiana* and *E. wachenheimii* from *E. coriacea* and *E. grandiflora from 2* with *E. pedicellate* being intermediate, the first group mostly investing in big leaves with high chlorophyll content.

<!-- analysis of likelihood and predictions -->
The log likelihood was hardly interpretable (Figure \@ref(fig:loglikelihood)) because all traits did not have the same dataset for the model inferences, thus, log likelihoods were computed with different numbers of terms and were intrinsically different. 
<!-- Yet, LDMC and CC which were the only ones to have the same dataset, revealed that the model fitted better LDMC than CC. -->
However, log-likelihoods and values of $\sigma^2$ brought together an insight on whether the model fitted better to some traits. Low values of likelihood were systematically associated with high $\sigma^2$. Thus, differences in dataset did not distort log-likelihoods.
LDMC had the highest log-likelihood and also the lowest $\sigma^2$ ($\sigma^2=0.098$), i.e. the part that remained unexplained by the model was low regarding LDMC mean ($\overline{LDMC}=0.985$ when reduced).
Therefore, sigma values highlighted that the model fitted more with LDMC, then CC ($\sigma^2=0.151$), invSLA ($\sigma^2=0.200$), LT ($\sigma^2=0.209$) and finally invLA ($\sigma^2=0.346$). 


Predictions graphs (Figure \@ref(fig:predictions)) depicted a general trend of traits to being constant with TWI, all others descriptors being fixed to their means. However, with TWI fixed, traits evolution displayed a Michaelis-Menten shape.

## Quantification of environmental and ontogenical effect on functional traits at the individual level
<!-- analysis of parameters -->

$\alpha$, ${\beta_{DBH}}_{c}$ and ${\beta_{TWI}}_{c}$ were the three parameters that supported the effects of selected descriptors. Distributions of ${\beta_{TWI}}_{c}$ (Figure \@ref(fig:posteriorsbeta)) displayed that 50% confidence intervals always overlapped zero value for LDMC, invSLA and LT. Therefore, TWI did not have a significant effect on these traits. However, for invLA and CC, ${\beta_{TWI}}_{c}$ had significant values. Water accumulation increased the chlorophyll content of *Eschweilera clade Parvifolia* species (${\beta_{TWI}}_{Eschweilera}=0.08$) and had the reverse effect for *Symphonia globulifera*.  It also increased leaf area of *Symphonia globulifera* (as the trait used is $\frac{1}{LA}$). 

On the other hand, $\alpha$ and ${\beta_{DBH}}_{c}$ ranged in strictly positive values
for each traits, except for $\alpha_{Eschweilera}$ of invLA which was not significant. The intercept took values in a very narrow interval, from 0.74 up to 1.09.

${\beta_{DBH}}_{c}$ took values in $[0,0.25]$, but more contrasted relatively to the interval width. For instance, ${\beta_{DBH}}_{Eschweilera}$ for LDMC was ten time lower than ${\beta_{DBH}}_{Symphonia}$ for LT. Consequently, ontogeny affected the increasment of traits with a different strength, making traits evolve ten time slowlier with ontogeny, when comparing extrema of ${\beta_{DBH}}_{c}$. 
$\{beta_{DBH}}_{90}$ was computed as the value of DBH - when DBH not reduced nor centered - for which the trait account for 90% of its maximum value (Table \@ref(tab:beta90)). $\{beta_{DBH}}_{90}$ enabled to assess until which DBH the trait was still affected by ontogenic stage. $\{beta_{DBH}}_{90}$ taking values lower than 10cm, as *Eschweilera clade parvifolia* for LDMC and for CC, can be considered non significant because measures only concerned trees of diameters above 10cm. 
$\{{beta_{DBH}}_{90}}_{Symphonia}$ for invSLA, LT and invLA, and $\{{beta_{DBH}}_{90}}_{Eschveilera}$ for invaLA were particularly high, respectively 52.2,60.8, 43.3 and 137.4 showing thaht traits reached their maximum trait values with late ontogenic stage.
All parameters that were significant also displayed significant differences between complexes.

## Quantification of intraspecific variability of traits
<!-- analysis of sigma -->
For every traits, $\sigma^2_{species}$ were all significantly positive. Order of magnitude in which they ranged were, however, really contrasted. 

$\sigma^2_{intercept}$ ranged in $[0,0.4]$ which never accounted for more than 50% of their $\alpha_{intercept}$ values, showing that species trait did not have radically different trends that offset each other around their complex means. Conversely, $\sigma^2_{intercept}$ of invLA was 0.81 which accounted for more than 70% of complexes parameters (0.29 and 1.09 for Eschweilera and Symphonia $\alpha_{intercept}$ respectively), highlighting how species had a great variability regarding mean trend of complexes.

$\sigma^2_{DBH}$ behaved in a different way as it took values that ranges in the same order of magnitude of linked $\{beta_{DBH}}_c$. $\sigma^2_{DBH}$ represented often more than 50% of $\{beta_{DBH}}_c$, e.g. for LT, $\sigma^2_{DBH}=0.08$ when $\{beta_{DBH}}_{Eschweilera}=0.06$ and $\{beta_{DBH}}_{Symphonia}=0.22$, thus, species could vary from about 36% to 133% around complex mean.

Similarly, $\sigma^2_{TWI}$ took values between 0.05 and 0.1, which represented for significant $\beta_{TWI}$ always more than 60% of their value. Traits for which $\beta_{TWI}$ (i.e. invSLA , LDMC and LT) did not have significant values had $\sigma^2_{TWI}$ of about 0.07, i.e. of the same order of magnitude of significant $\beta_{TWI}$. Therefore, traits for which $\beta_{TWI}$ were not significant could have been caracterize by species that reacted to TWI, but in antagonistic ways.
