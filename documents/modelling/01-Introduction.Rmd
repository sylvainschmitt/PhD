# Introduction {-}

This chapter tries to portray options in (i) methodology, (ii) processes, and (iii) outcomes.

## Methodology

* Population-based
* Individual-based
    * might be needed for individual genotypic evolution
* Processus-based
* Sotck/Flux-based
* Spatially-explicit
    * might be needed for forest gaps dynamics
* Genetically-explicit
    * might be avoided to gain simplicity
* matrix models for populations with stages

### Tools

* **TROLL** for gaps only [@Chave1999; @Marechaux2017]
* **FORMIND** [@Kohler1998]
* **SELVA** to model growth directly, include a genetics module
* **SELVa** changing fitness landscape, only evolution
* **@Vellend2006a** lotka-Voltera spatialized
* **@Ellner1994** differential equations overlapping generations of 
* Ordinary differential equations (ODE, possible in `stan` [see for instance](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/BiogecoBayes/workshop6_ODE_SIR.html))
* Eco-Gene Degen et al.,
* RangeShifter

## Processes

* Species adaptations
    * to topography
* Genotypic adaptations
    * microgeogrpahic
    * to forest gaps dynamics
* Phenotypic plasticity
    * noise
    * ontogeny
    * reaction norm
    * heritability
* Mating
    * random
    * assortative
* Time
    * year
* Space
    * 2D explicit
    * non explicit
* Fitness
    * indirect growth, survival and reproduction (process based)
* Genetics
    * implicit
    * explicit
    * evolving traits
    * loci
    * neutral genes
    * mutations
    * ploidy
    * inheritance

## Outcomes

* Stability conditions
* Key factors (sensitivity analysis)
    * topography vs forest gap dynamics on genotypic vs species structure
* System natural evolution under stable environment
* System answer to disturbances (CC)
