# Introduction {-}

This document address the joint effects of topography and forest gap dynamics on the conditions for tree species coexistence discussed in my [PhD thesis](https://phdthesissylvainschmitt.netlify.app/thesis.pdf).
It follows and uses the development of the package `ecoevosimulator` available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sylvainschmitt/ecoevosimulator) as a different project. 
More particularly, a user interface is hosted on [ShinyApps](https://sylvainschmitt.shinyapps.io/ecoevosimulator/) to run the simulator.
We specifically wanted to address the following questions:

1. What are the conditions for the stable coexistence of genotypes and species with topography and/or forest gap dynamics in the forest community?
    * One species with continuous genotypes only with forest gap dynamics
    * One species with continuous genotypes only with topography
    * One species with continuous genotypes with both topography and forest gap dynamics
    * Starting from a random distribution
    * Coexistence versus outcompetition conditions
1. What are the conditions for the successful establishment of genotypic adaptations to forest gap dynamics in the forest community?
1. What are the conditions for the reinforcement of species barriers or speciation of species connected through gene flow along topography?
