# Introduction

## *Why studying biodiversity ?*

Characterizing biological diversity, or so-called biodiversity, and understanding its causes and consequences have been central to the development of ecology and evolution [@Messier2010]. Three simple questions arise from this statement: (1) what is biodiversity, (2) what is the cause of its existence, (3) and what are the consequences of its existence. Characterizing biodiversity is a *sine qua non* condition to embrace the two following questions. Once the biodiversity is characterized we can study its causes. But biodiversity is dynamic, so we can study its origin, maintenance, and future, or more generally how it evolves. Once biodiversity is characterized, we can also study consequences of its existence. But this is a different question which will not be addressed here despite a huge literature around the question [@Cardinale2012; @diaz_biodiversity_2006; @Liang2016; @Loreau2000; @Naeem2002; @Oliver2015; @Yachi1999].

## *What is biodiviersity ?*

Biodiversity can be divided in three fundamental categories: genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. Ecosystem diversity encompass the range of terrestrial and aquatic environments found on earth classified into ecosystems. Ecosystems encompass both the biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Moreover, species diversity represents species in which are categorized the interacting organisms of the ecosystem. Species have been defined as groups of organisms which are reproducing isolated from other such groups, protecting the integrity of their genotypes [@Mayr1996]. This reflects the biological species concept based on reproductive isolation. But species concepts and definitions have been largely debated [@Mayden1997], especially concerning plants, and many species concepts can be defined (phylogenetic, biological, ecological, morphological or genetic, see @DeQueiroz2007). However, individuals presents variations in performance, phenotypes, and genes within species itself representing genetic diversity. To avoid any further confusions we will use intraspecific variability to qualificate this biodiversity level, comprising individual diversity, genetic diversity, intraspecific trait variability, and phenotypic variability.

## *What are the causes of biodiversity existence ?*

Earth present a large amount of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Among them, the outstanding biodiversity of coral reefs and tropical rainforests has always fascinated ecologists [@connell_diversity_1978], and so they represent interesting ecosystems to study. At the species level, different theories have been developed to explain the persistence of biodiversity. Niche theory explains species coexistence depending on niche differences to limit competitive exclusion [@Weiher; @lortie_rethinking_2004-1], while neutral theory shows that maintenance of high diversity is possible even for functionally equivalent species, because of stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001]. But numerous theories exists [@wright2002plant]. Still, theories often ignore genetic biodiversity represented by intraspecific variability arising from individual diversity inside populations and communities. Yet, numerous studies have shown that intraspecific variation, besides being often ignored, is large and might play an important role at population and community level, as well as being one of the causes of biodiversity origin and maintenance. 

# Instraspecific variability importance

## Intraspecific variability is ignored

Intraspecific variability is a central topic in ecology and evolutionary biology and yet relatively unknown [@Hallgrimsson2005]. For instance with trees, individual variability regarding crown size and light interception is often relegated to an error term and ignored when interpreting ecological processes [@Vieilledent2010]. Nevertheless several authors advocates for a better understanding of intraspecific variability role in ecology [@Albert2010; @Albert2011a; @chave_neutral_2004; @Violle2012].

## Intraspecific variation is large

Despite being often ignored, literature has recently shown that intraspecific variation was relatively large. @Vieilledent2010 found individual variability to account for a large amount of the variation in tree allometric relations. Several authors particularly assessed intraspecific variation of functional traits called intraspecific trait variability. @Hulshof2010, partitioning variation of leaf traits in costa rican dry forest, found that intraspecific trait variability ranged from 36 to 83% of total variance whereas @Messier2010 found 12 to 30% of variation. At the community level, @Siefert2015a meta-analysis found on average an overall intraspecific trait variation (ITV) of 25% within communities and 32% among communities. Finally, @LeBagousse-Pinguet2014 assessed directly functional diversity within-species between 13.5 and 33.6% of total functional diversity.

## Intraspecific variability play a role at community level

Beyond intraspecific variability assessment, some studies investigated the role of intraspecific variability in community assembly. @Messier2010 found a lack of variance at the plot level interpreted as a trait-based environmental filtering and a important role of intraspecific variability in plant community assembly.  Intraspecific variability role was highlighted in community assembly shift due to environmental gradient in space or time. @Siefert2016 found intraspecific variability to drive shifts of mean height, leaf area and specific leaf area (SLA) following grassland fertilization. In addition, @Jung2010 found community mean specific leaf area (SLA) and height significantly varying along a flooding gradient, where intraspecific variability accounted for 44 and 32%, respectively of the trait-gradient relationships. Moreover, patterns of niche differentiation were revealed only when intraspecific variability was taken into account [@Jung2010]. Similarly, @Paine2011 found intraspecific trait data to be more sensitive and a better indicator of both niche differentiation and environmental filtering than interspecific trait data. Finally, complementary studies used simulations to investigate long term possible impact of intraspecific variability on communities. @Barabas2016 models highlighted a better resilience and stability of community assembly for heritable traits. @Vellend2006a models highlighted the role of intraspecific variability through genetic diversity on both community species diversity and composition.

## Intraspecific variability play a role in biodiversity origin and maintenance

<!-- **Take care to differentiate hypothesis and evidences !** -->

Several authors suggested hypothesis or have shown evidence of intraspecific variability [@Lichstein2007]. Following observations of community trait shifts due to intraspecific variability, @Jung2010 concluded that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by facilitating species to pass through environmental filtering. In addition, studying limestone grassland functional diversity, @LeBagousse-Pinguet2014 were able to relate increasing interspecific trait overlap through increased intraspecific variability to a greater species coexistence. Effectively, @Clark2010 suggested that intraspecific variability allows species to differ in their distribution of the response to the environment and thus to pass environmental filtering, which would have occurred on species average. @Clark2010 found this hypothesis to be consistent with theories that predict a better species coexistence with competition being stronger within than between species. Similarly, @Chesson2000a suggested that intraspecific variability promotes species coexistence through stabilizing mechanisms "if negative intraspecific interactions tend to be greater than intraspecific interactions". In addition, some authors suggested that intraspecific level should held evidences of mechanisms promoting species coexistence and thus biodiversity. @Laughlin2013 suggested to test limiting similarity hypothesis in the trait space incorporating intraspecific variability. Similarly, @Laughlin2012 suggested that intraspecific variability could answer paradox in theories of species coexistence.

Intraspecific variability might play a different role depending on the studied organism. More especially, long-lived species, as tropical trees, have high ontogenetic variation and phenotypic plasticity that might be resulting of a high intraspecific variability to face environmental hazards before they reach sexual maturity [@Borges2009; @Sultan1987]. Similarly, @Callaway2003 suggested that intraspecific variability, through phenotypic plasticity in response to neighbors, might promote community diversity and species coexistence, letting species adjust the composition of their population.

Finally, @Aarssen1983 suggested the "competitive combining ability" hypothesis which hypothesize species coexistence to held on the ability of each species to respond to spatial and variable selection imposed by neighbors. Thus, this species ability of answering selection promotes biodiversity through species coexistence and stabilize species composition among communities [@Vellend2006a].

# Origin and maintenance of intraspecific variability

Intraspecific variability is ultimately represented by phenotypic variation among ecosystems. Phenotypic variation will be shaped by (i) genetic heritage, through genotypes, (ii) environment (both abiotic and biotic) with spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and (iii) random through stochastic factors [@Whitlock2007].

## Genotypic variability

We consider the genotype to be a strong determinant of the phenotype in a given environment. Especially, tree species have great size, long life time, numerous seeds, large effective population sizes [@Brown2004], outcrossing mating system and maintain a strong gene flow [@Hamrick1992; @Nybom2004]. Thus, forest trees present a large degree of local adaptation [@Savolainen2013]. In a nutshell, tropical tree genetic diversity [@Scotti2016] in combination to the environment results in phenotypic variability [@Albert2015] and ultimately to *in situ* performance differences [@Bec2015]. Genetic local adaptation arises from new mutations, standing genetic variation and adaptive introgression [@Tigano2016].

If we focus on tropical tree species two other points might be important regarding genotypic variability. First, selection is very strong at early life stages in forest trees: this is the moment where the largest changes in allele frequencies occur between generations. The responses of different individuals to selection pressures can be highly variable, across a population at a given time, but also potentially across time for a given individual, and response can be non-linear and counter-intuitive. Given such processes, to understand adaptive processes in the population one should examine large sample sizes. And, since density-related processes seem to matter, it might be more pertinent to reason in terms of the response in the species per area, than in terms of individual-based response to selection. Secondly, tropical tree species include species that share alleles frequently considered as belonging to species complexes, which largely share genetic variation because of hybridization or common ancestry. It increases the genetic diversity on which selection can act, thus increasing the chances for local adaptation to happen. Hence, species complexes represents potentially interesting study case for intraspecific variability in the scope of the genotype-phenotype relation.

## Environmental heterogeneity

Local environment is both abiotic (nutrients, water, light...) and biotic (competition, predation). In addition, environmental variations have both spatial (e.g., topography, soil variables) and temporal (water availability, light environment, competitors) components. We hypothesize environmental heterogeneity to be a major factor of intraspecific variability. Hence, we believe that long lived woody species as tropical tree present a certain degree of local adaptation to the fine heterogeneity of the environment. Consequently, we postulate that environmental variation should explain a higher proportion of phenotypic variation given the genotype than what is currently demonstrated and should be highlighted when studying genotype-phenotype interactions. Effectively, phenotypic plasticity of plants to abiotic environment and biotic through neighbors can result in genetically identical individuals with very different phenotypes [@Callaway2003]. Finally, regarding intraspecific variability, environmental variation has a temporal component that has been little exploited to our knowledge and which should also be explored.

## Phenotypic variability

A static genotype is transcribed into RNA under the influence of environmental cues, leading to the production of a metabolic signal, which results in a more complex phenotypic trait expression, ultimately resulting in individual performance. Thus, phenotypes are composed of traits, from simple (metabolites) to complex (growth). Phenotypes can vary across the lifespan of individuals in so called phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity can play on morphology, physiology, phenology, and ontogeny [@Turcotte2016]. Phenotypic plasticity can be reversible, also called phenotypic flexibility, or irreversible, also called development plasticity [@Turcotte2016]. Consequently, populations within species adapt to the environment at short term through phenotypic flexibility, over a lifetime through development plasticity, and among individuals and generation through local adaptations. @Turcotte2016 suggested that intraspecific variability for many phenotypic traits was due to phenotypic plasticity, thus reinforcing the role of the environment. Similarly, @Ashton2010 were able to show that superior competitors exhibit higher resource use plasticity of nitrogen than inferior competitors, highlighting the role of phenotypic plasticity in biotic interactions. So, as mentioned above we should better disentangle the role of genotype and environment, which might be undermined, in the resulting intraspecific variability. 

Similarly to genotypic variability, focusing on tropical forest might bring *the problem of the winners*. In most of current studies, we observe the phenotypes after the worst period of selection (trees with a diameter at breast height over 10 centimeters). Some researchers use currently diachronic approaches, e.g., examining cohorts of individuals established under variable past environmental conditions (pre-industrial, post-industrial, recent). Perhaps examining allele frequencies in seeds, seedlings, or saplings gives a view on how selection changes allele frequencies. One can also follow a given cohort for several years and monitor changes in allele frequencies “in real time”. 

# Conclusion

## Intraspecific variability and Biodiversity

Understanding characteristics, causes and consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge to ecology and evolution. Biodiversity presents three nested levels going from individual to ecosystem, through the species concept. Yet, species concepts and definition have been largely debated. Moreover, most of biodiversity origin and maintenance theories stand on the species level. 

However, little is known about intraspecific variability, the individual level of biodiversity. Despite a large amount of evidences of important intraspecific variability, notably in ecologically important phenotypic traits, we still know little about the effects of this intraspecific variability on population dynamics, species interactions and ecosystem processes [@Hughes2008; @Mittelbach2015a]. On the other hand, several studies have shown or suggested an important role of intraspecific variability at community level promoting species coexistence and thus biodiversity origin and maintenance. 

Intraspecific variability results ultimately in phenotypic variation. Phenotypic variation will be shaped by the interaction between the genotype and the environment. That is why @Hughes2008 synthesis suggests that : "future studies of the ecological effects of genetic diversity should draw on classic approaches in evolutionary biology to identify genotype–phenotype relationships, which should advance our mechanistic understanding of genetic diversity effects."

## Future directions

Consequently, we want to further explore genoptype-environment interaction in shaping the phenotypic variability of species, and thus get insights into origins and roles of intraspecific variability in biodiversity origin and maintenance. We thus want to follow recommendation of @Turcotte2016 to further progress on both the empirical and theoretical front for a more general integration of plasticity, intraspecific variation, and rapid evolution into community ecology. Consequently we could help to build a theory of  community ecology starting with individuals, because interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment are ultimately based at the level of the individual [@Violle2012].

@Hughes2008 suggested to focus those studies on the dominant species of the ecosystem having the most wide-ranging effects at the ecosystem level. Then, we should focus on tree species if we are interested in the outstanding diversity of tropical forests. Moreover, species complexes represents potentially interesting study case for intraspecific variability in the scope of the genotype-phenotype relation due to their consequently high genetic diversity.

Genetic markers have already been shown to be useful to help understand the role of intraspecific variability in promoting biodiversity [@Whitlock2007]. Regarding methods, one useful important point unraveled by @Hughes2008 is methods from the species diversity are seldom applicable for the intraspecific variability. Nevertheless, @Whitlock2007 warned about the study of genotype-environment interactions in natural communities, such as tropical forest, due to the myriad ways in which genotypes can interact with their environment.

Consequently, intraspecific variability in the population should be examined with large sample sizes. In addition, since density-related processes seem to matter, it might be more pertinent to reason in terms of the response in the species per area, than in terms of individual-based response to selection. Finally, diachronic study of allele frequencies in seeds, seedlings, or saplings could give a view on how selection changes allele frequencies

To conclude, one way to simplify the system for a better understanding of processes is to start with the genotype being the only parameter static over an individual lifespan, contrarily to environment and phenotype. Consequently, we should first focus on the link between genotypes and environmental conditions through ecological genomics. Once the genotype-environment links unraveled, we can then move forward by exploring the role of the interaction in shaping phenotypic variability. A second asset can be to move progressively into the exploration of the role of genotype-environment interaction with phenotype by using progressively more and more complex traits, from simple (e.g. metabolites) to complex (e.g. growth).
